With that in mind, it is simply amazing when any actor manages to have a lengthy career at the top of the business, which is something that Rob Lowe definitely has accomplished.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a successful and seemingly ageless actor, Rob Lowe</a> has gotten to enjoy a seemingly endless array of perks. For example, Lowe has been famous for decades and that comes along with things like preferential treatment when he is in public, the adoration of millions, and much more. That said, it could easily be argued that the best thing that Lowe’s career has given him is massive paycheques for his work.</p><p>While there is no way for the general public to know exactly how much money Rob Lowe has, according to multiple reports, his net worth is $60 million. While most observers may assume where he earned all of that cash, in reality, Lowe has made money in many different ways over the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Nicholson Made $50 Million As The Joker. Here’s How He Did It</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=major-movie-star>Major Movie Star</h2><p>One of a slew of young actors who rose to prominence during the ‘80s, the media included Rob Lowe in a group they dubbed the Brat Pack. Memorably seen on the big screen with other members of that group in St. Elmo’s Fire, including Demi Moore, Emilio Estevez, and Judd Nelson, that film turned Lowe into a movie star.</p><p>A bona fide teen idol during the ‘80s, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Lowe co-starred with lots of other young stars including Tom Cruise in The Outsiders</a>. Involved in a major scandal in 1988, after a recording of him in an intimate moment with a young woman was leaked to the public, Lowe’s career took a major hit at that time.</p><p>Before too long Lowe’s movie career made a comeback, albeit in supporting roles more often than not. Hired to appear in a long list of comedies, Lowe had a memorable in films like the Austin Powers franchise, Wayne’s World, Tommy Boy, and The Invention of Lying.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandra Bullock Has A Huge $250 Million Net Worth: Here’s How She Made Her Money</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taking-a-different-route>Taking A Different Route</h2><p>Once Rob Lowe became famous, he spent several years of his life principally focusing on movie roles. However, all of that changed once he took a starring role in The West Wing, an incredibly successful series that redefined his career. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Lowe quit The West Wing, which was a shocking albeit not unheard of decision</a>, Lowe tenure on the show received nearly universal praise.</p><p>After Rob Lowe made the surprising decision to leave a highly successful series, he quickly became a mainstay of network television. Unfortunately for him, several of Lowe’s initial post-West Wing shows failed to find a big enough audience. On the other hand, Lowe played a memorable role in the show Brothers & Sisters for 4 seasons.</p><p>After proving himself as a comedic actor on the big screen, Rob Lowe joined the cast of Parks and Recreation and quickly became one of that show’s highlights for many viewers. In recent years, Lowe has also starred in shows like The Grinder and 9-1-1: Lone Star, on top of voicing Simba in 23 episodes of Disney’s The Lion Guard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bam Margera Used To Have A $45 Million Net Worth, Here’s What He Has Left Today</a></span></p><h2 id=other-ways-rob-lowe-has-built-his-fortune>Other Ways Rob Lowe Has Built His Fortune</h2><p>Given the fact that starring in a movie or TV show or movie typically involves long hours on set, it makes sense that so many people assume that Rob Lowe has earned his fortune from acting alone. However, in reality, his interests are a lot more diverse than many observers realize. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Lowe has collected some large paycheques for other forms of work</a>.</p><p>Able to land a deal with one of the top publishers in the world, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Lowe’s 2011 book “Stories I Only Tell My Friends was such a big hit that he has toured telling stories from it to live audiences</a>. Still not through with the writing world, Lowe followed up his first book with a second memoir, “Love Life”, 3 years later and it too was a hit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Due to the fact that Rob Lowe is a beloved celebrity, it was only a matter of time before some major brands came knocking at his door. Hired as DirecTV’s spokesperson in 2014, he has worked with that company for many years. On top of that, in 2017 he starred in several KFC commercials as an astronaut version of Colonel Sanders. Finally, Atkins Nutritionals hired Lowe as their spokesman due to his “low carb lifestyle”.</p><p>Finally, Rob Lowe is a businessman in his own right as he has brought a couple of products to the market. For example, Lowe has a men’s skincare product line called Profile which has been sold online and in Nordstrom stores, which says a lot since they sell many high-end products. Still not through, Lowe also has a fragrance called 18 Amber Wood.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything Fans Forget About Rob Lowe</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipqJpdoby4sYynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMb2dmpZmhuaq7zWajop6VqMG6uMRo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frob-lowe-net-worth-60-million-lifestyle.html&text=Here%27s%20How%20Rob%20Lowe%20Amassed%20His%20%2460%20Million%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frob-lowe-net-worth-60-million-lifestyle.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frob-lowe-net-worth-60-million-lifestyle.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Rob%20Lowe%20Amassed%20His%20%2460%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frob-lowe-net-worth-60-million-lifestyle.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Rob%20Lowe%20Amassed%20His%20%2460%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frob-lowe-net-worth-60-million-lifestyle.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Rob%20Lowe%20Amassed%20His%20%2460%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frob-lowe-net-worth-60-million-lifestyle.html&description=Here%27s%20How%20Rob%20Lowe%20Amassed%20His%20%2460%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tyrese-1-million-lawsuit-home-depot-surveillance-footage-1234796448.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Home Depot Shares Surveillance Footage After Tyrese $1 Million Lawsuit">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./henry-winkler-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Henry Winkler Net Worth  How Much is Henry Worth?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
