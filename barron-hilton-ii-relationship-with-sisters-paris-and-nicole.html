A household name as a reality star, she's helped maintain the relevance of the Hilton dynasty. However, she does have some less-famous siblings that are just as important to the Hilton regime.</p><p>While Paris and Nicole are colossal reality show stars, Barron Hilton has kept the lowest profile of the siblings. He is somewhat famous, mainly due to his food-centric social media posts. Many fans wonder about him and his relationship with his sisters - here's everything to know.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-barron-hilton-the-second-worth>How Much Is Barron Hilton The Second Worth?</h2><p>Barron certainly had the most private childhood out of all his siblings. Not many details are known about his background and what he was like growing up. The same really can't be said for his siblings, most of all Paris.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Barron Hilton II Isn't Afraid To Live Life Large, Here's What We Know About His Lavish Personal Life</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Biography Mask, Barron was born on November 7th, 1989, making him 32 years old. His exact birthplace is unknown, but he definitely grew up in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Barron has a net worth of $5 million. He hasn't exactly inherited all of his money, as he has acted in TV shows and movies. Per IMDb, Barron has appeared in 2015's En Passant, a short film he also wrote and directed.</p><p>He also appeared in Metamorphosis: Junior Year, and Spring to Winter. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Kidadl</a>, Barron also has a prestigious role on the board of his family's Hilton company as Senior Vice President.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/barron-hilton-and-wife-png2.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Barron has made some money as an influencer on social media as well. He typically posts about his family life, but he also will occasionally post about food, horror movies, and fashion. He currently has 1 million followers on Instagram.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to People</a>, Barron has been married to Tessa von Walderdorff since 2018. For those who are unaware, Walderdorff is a real estate investor, as well as a social media influencer. She's even acted at some points throughout her career and has a couple of writing credits for various German magazines.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Inside Barron Hilton II And Wife's Insanely Impressive Net Worths</a></span></p><p>Barron's family life including his wife seems great, but how great is it truly?

She has a ton of clothing lines and even some jewelry products under her name.</p><p>Nicole also lives a private life, so naturally, there isn't a lot of information known about her relationship with Barron. They have been pictured together at various events, including a few fashion shows.

She was raised in Beverly Hills, California, another great-grandchild of Conrad Hilton.</p><p>She is one of today’s most recognizable entrepreneurs and international influencers.

During the paparazzi boom of the early 2000s, round-the-clock coverage of her led to her completely revolutionalizing fashion as we know it. The sudden popularity of luxury bags and Ugg boots could not have happened without Hilton. Even the Kardashians in today's world aren't as impactful as Hilton was 20 years ago.</p><p>She's even advocated for human rights, something her haters would have never expected her to do. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Dazed Digital</a>, Paris called for a bill of rights to protect younger people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/paris-hilton-testifying-in-the-utah-state-senate.jpg><p><a href=#>Paris is known for her friendships with stars such as Kim Kardashian</a>, but does she get along with her brother Barron?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once again, due to Barron's private life, their relationship isn't known as well as some other famous siblings. However, according to an article on DoveClove, Paris and Barron trust each other. They've always gotten along pretty well behind the scenes. Barron has always accepted her for who she is, despite some of the more controversial moments in her life.</p><p>According to Brides.com, Paris attended Barron's 2018 wedding in the Caribbean.
