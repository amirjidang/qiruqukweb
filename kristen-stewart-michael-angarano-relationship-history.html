The two <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">began dating as teens after they met on the set</a> of the independent coming-of-age Speak which is based on the 1999 novel of the same name by Laurie Halse Anderson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, both actors weren't well-known names in the industry and their careers grew together which must have been a big bonding point for them.</p><p>However, in 2008, Stewart was cast as Bella Swan in the romantic fantasy movie Twilight which is based on Stephenie Meyer's 2005 novel of the same name. With that role, she quickly rose to international fame.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Kristen Stewart Went From Most Hated Lists To A Fan Favorite Actress">How Kristen Stewart Went From Most Hated Lists To A Fan Favorite Actress</a></span></p><p>Besides Will & Grace, Michael Angarano is also known for starring in shows like Cover Me, I'm Dying Up Here, and This Is Us, as well as movies cush as Sky High, The Forbidden Kingdom, and The English Teacher.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For his portrayal of Nick Pearson in the family drama This Is Us, in 2019 Angarano was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in the category Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.</p><h2 id=did-kristen-stewart-break-up-with-michael-angarano-because-of-robert-pattinson>Did Kristen Stewart Break Up With Michael Angarano Because Of Robert Pattinson?</h2><p>Stewart and Angarano dated for almost four years — according to Who's Dated Who, the couple <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">officially parted ways in May 2009</a>.

"But I understand why you would assume that when we lean on each other for support, there must be something more."

In April 2009 the two were photographed having fun as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stewart got a piggyback ride from Angarano</a>.</p><p>A week prior the actress was seen holding hands with Robert Pattinson while they weren't filming, which is why many believe Kristen Stewart ended up ditching Michael Angarano for her co-star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Vulture from 2012, Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she thought Stewart and Angarano were a great couple</a>. "He's a wonderful actor. He was in Dogtown, one of my favorites, so I felt pretty bad because I love him and they were such a great couple," Hardwicke admitted.</p><p>Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson dated all through the release of the rest of the Twilight Saga movies.
