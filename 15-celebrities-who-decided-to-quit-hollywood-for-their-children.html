People might wonder if these sacrifices are at all needed but you ask any parent, and the answer will be yes. Anything for their children. Motherhood or fatherhood is an incredible feeling, and the parents do not even think twice to do what is right for their kids without giving a second thought to what they lose.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Celebrities are people who chase after money, name, fame for whole life to be successful, but some of these successful people are also the ones who do not even hesitate to leave everything for their kids. We can find many cases where celebrities hardly care to finish their money-making career for the sake of keeping the family health and kids in the right shape. The thought of security, love and ultimate good for the children can even make these heartthrobs more popular. There are Hollywood celebrities who are ready to let go of their successful and glamorous life&nbsp;in order to give their children the best possible life.</p><p>Love for children makes these fifteen big stars of Hollywood quit their job, choosing instead to be an A-List parent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessica-biel-and-justin-timberlake>JESSICA BIEL AND JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE</h2><p>Remember Jessica Biel and her role as Erin Hardesty in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre? She also starred in Hollywood films like The Rules of Attraction, Blade: Trinity, Stealth, The Illusionist, The A-Team, Total recall and many more. On the other hand, the American singer-songwriter Justin Timberlake is also famous for his solo music career with numerous awards including Grammy, Emmy, Billboards, and others. Jessica Biel was actively involved in the Hollywood industry when she and her husband, Justin Timberlake became the proud parents of their son Silas. Starting from that moment, the new mom slowly disappeared from her active role in the industry in just three years. She is not to blame for her choice because she wanted to witness every milestone in her son's life. She used to post on Instagram now and then, but&nbsp;not as much anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jessica is playing the significant role of the entirely dedicated mother which would set an example for her son. That is not all; she is actively supporting charitable causes apart from being a full-time homemaker.&nbsp;She is clearly making sure that she creates a home for her son that is both nurturing and caring, not just for each other but for others as well. She is definitely putting her son above Hollywood. (Source: Thetalko.com)</p><h2 id=shania-twain>SHANIA TWAIN</h2><p>The country-pop queen Shania Twain can spin hay into gold in real life. Her story is interesting, and itâ€™s all about rags to riches transformation of a country girl. We all know her country-pop songs and love it. She can do it all: singing, dancing,&nbsp;and writes her music. She proved herself every time on shows with her mind-blowing performances. But mothers can do wonders. At the peak of the career when her son Eja took birth, Shania decided to leave&nbsp;Hollywood behind.</p><p>Twain and her hubby Robert Lange decided to relocate to Switzerland leaving behind Canada and USA to dedicate their full time to their son so they could focus fully on him. Shaniaâ€™s songs include greatest selling hits of all time but all she wanted was peace for her child and to grow him without any noise and haste.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The time when the child needed the mother most, Shania ardently supported that need by sacrificing her bright future. Now, that her boy has grown up, she can manage both the career and family, so no wonder she is set to blow up the music world once again. A woman can achieve a lot but a mother sometimes has to make a choice between what they want and what is good for her child. If you're Shania Twain of course, you can have both.

Even after more than a decade she still enjoys being a mom and staying home supporting the children full time. Such is the pattern of mothers that they do not even hesitate to leave the hall of fame behind and consider their family everything.

One can surely imagine his contribution to the Hollywood industry if he continued his great path and remained a part of Hollywood. It is tough to understand why great people leave everything behind&nbsp;after they worked so hard to earn it, but that is what parenthood is. Having a child prompts them to take such decisions.

She is happy with the life she is leading&nbsp;than she ever was in the film industry and set an example that success cannot take mothers away from children. Considering her acting talents, Hollywood needs Vera more than she needs Hollywood. (Source: Thestir.cafemom.com, Babygaga.com, Imdb.com)</p><h2 id=michael-schoeffling>MICHAEL SCHOEFFLING</h2><p>The former American actor and model Michael Schoeffling is well-known for his sweet role as Jake Ryan opposite Molly Ringwald in the mega-hit Sixteen Candles. This iconic teen heartthrob was mind-blowing on screen as a senior student of high school to win over the hearts of the women. After so much success in that role, he also played in Vision Quest as Kuch and as Joe Perretti in Mermaids, but those couldn't make an impression they were meant to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michael left his acting career at the age of just 31 in 1991, and that decision was taken for the good of his family. He wanted to raise his children Scarlet, and Zane out of the industry, and so he moved out east with ex-wife Valerie C. Robinson who used to be a model. He proved that not only mothers but fathers can also leave behind bright career for the sake of children without thinking of the name, fame, and fortune. Michael devoted himself full time to raise his kids and maintain his family life. He also started a woodworking shop for carpentry work and handcrafted furniture. He might have left all the name and fame behind, but Michael Schoeffling still has the impression of the hunky high school student in the minds of the people.
