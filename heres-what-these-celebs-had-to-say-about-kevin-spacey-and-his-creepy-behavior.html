His career was peppered with wildly successful films such as American Beauty,The Usual Suspects, and House Of Cards,&nbsp;to name a few. At the height of his career, he was a well respected actor, and was one of Hollywood's favorite, most familiar faces.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, his entire reputation took a huge hit when a number of accusers came forward with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">allegations of sexual assault</a> and misconduct. Since then, his career took an absolute nose-dive, and his friends, fans, and fellow celebrities turned against him, with complete disdain over his actions. Some celebrities have spoken out against the former star, depicting their rage over his<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> creepy behavior.</a></p><h2 id=alyssa-milano><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Alyssa Milano</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Anthony Rapp accused Kevin Spacey of inappropriate sexual advances when he was juts 14-years-old, Kevin Spacey released a highly controversial video response that set fans and colleagues into a flurry of concern. The video was a clear depiction of his lack of empathy in them matter, and Alyssa Milano was among the first stars to speak out. She urged fans to let his behavior speak for itself and called his responses "disturbing" and accused him of chastising his audience. Her response garnered a lot of support from fellow stars.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Reacts To Kevin Spacey Being Cast In First Role Since Sexual Assault Allegations</a></span></p><h2 id=patricia-arquette><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Patricia Arquette</span></h2><p>Former star of Medium, Patricia Arquette,&nbsp;spoke out both against Kevin Spacey and in support of his victims. She slammed him for his inappropriate video and said that his victims surely didn't appreciate or need to be exposed to further toxicity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Newsday reported on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">heavy criticism that came his way</a> after being accused of making advances towards Rapp in 1986 were not something to deny or make light of, and Arquette expressed disgust for this display of poor behavior and Spacey's clear lack of remorse.</p><h2 id=wanda-sykes><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Wanda Sykes</span></h2><p>Wanda Sykes took aim at Spacey over his remarks about being gay and using his sexual orientation as a defense to "explain away" his behavior toward Rapp. The fact that Spacey said he "did not remember the encounter" that so clearly traumatized Rapp and have affected his whole life, really set off Wanda Sykes. She blasted Spacey for trying to hide behind his own terrible deeds and dragged him for misrepresenting the LGBTQ community. Sykes refused to accept this explanation as being acceptable, and pushed back on his<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> association with the gay community.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Moment Fans Started Turning On Kevin Spacey</a></span></p><h2 id=richard-lawson><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Richard Lawson</span></h2><p>Richard Lawson, best known for his incredible acting in the hit film&nbsp;Poltergeist, showed some empathy to the fact that it seemed Kevin Spacey, himself, was facing a personal struggle in his life. However, he is not willing to let go of the fact that no matter what personal issues Spacey was facing at the time, even if they were conflicting issues with his own sexuality, the fact remains that Rapp was just 14-years-old. Lawson makes it clear that 14-years-old is an age of innocence, and there is absolutely nothing to excuse Spacey's behavior towards that child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mena-suvari><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mena Suvari</span></h2><p>Mena Suvari opened up about a creepy encounter she had with Kevin Spacey on the set of American Beauty. She revealed that during the filming of this epic film, she was preparing to shoot an intimate scene with Spacey and indicated that she trusted him at the time. However, she tells Indie Wire she remembers getting what she describes as a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> "weird feeling" after he lay on the bed very close to her</a>, after taking her into a side room. She described the moment as being "peaceful but weird and unusual" and now says she looks back at it differently after learning about his sexually deviant practices.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Troll Bill Cosby As He Makes Strange Reference To Women</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=billy-eichner><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Billy Eichner</span></h2><p>Billy's impeccable skills as a talk show host has made him a fan-favorite for fans across the globe. When he spoke out against Kevin Spacey, his fans were definitely tuned in for the update. Billy sent a sarcastic message that was written with precision and clearly put Spacey's actions and responses in the spotlight. By writing; "Kevin Spacey has just invented something that has never existed before, a bad time to come out," he was declaring that even the gay community was not able to stand behind him in support. This was a clear misrepresentation of homosexuality, and Billy called Spacey out, point blank. Spacey had pushed this matter way too far.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ellen-barkin><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ellen Barkin</span></h2><p>Ellen Barkin holds a long history as an actress and producer and is behind hugely successful films such as Johnny Handsome and Sea Of Love. She drew on Kevin Spacey's work and life in a parallel fashion and accused him of chastising his audience. She rang in with the same message that others had for Spacey, which was that his messaging and responses to the allegations are disturbing and completely unacceptable to all involved.</p><h2 id=paula-pell><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Paula Pell</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paula Pell is best known for her time on Saturday Night Live, and she decided to keep the comedic commentary flowing with more than just a tinge of sarcasm. She mocked Kevin Spacey's futile efforts to hide behind his conflicted sexual identity and made it clear to him that he would not be embraced by the LGBTQ community. After trying to use his orientation to justify his malicious actions, he is not welcome nor will he be embraced by those who proudly declare themselves to be homosexual.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Reacts As Carroll Baker Defends Bill Cosby, 'It's A Sin He Was Jailed'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZK2glaiybq%2FEpZybq12drqV506hkrJmpYq6ju9StZKSdpp67br%2FPmpqesV2Wu6V5x6KqZpuimrKxxYybnKGZpp68s3s%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fheres-what-these-celebs-had-to-say-about-kevin-spacey-and-his-creepy-behavior.html&text=Here%27s%20What%20These%20Celebs%20Had%20To%20Say%20About%20Kevin%20Spacey%20And%20His%20%27Creepy%27%20Behavior&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-what-these-celebs-had-to-say-about-kevin-spacey-and-his-creepy-behavior.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-what-these-celebs-had-to-say-about-kevin-spacey-and-his-creepy-behavior.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20These%20Celebs%20Had%20To%20Say%20About%20Kevin%20Spacey%20And%20His%20%27Creepy%27%20Behavior" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fheres-what-these-celebs-had-to-say-about-kevin-spacey-and-his-creepy-behavior.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20These%20Celebs%20Had%20To%20Say%20About%20Kevin%20Spacey%20And%20His%20%27Creepy%27%20Behavior" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fheres-what-these-celebs-had-to-say-about-kevin-spacey-and-his-creepy-behavior.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20These%20Celebs%20Had%20To%20Say%20About%20Kevin%20Spacey%20And%20His%20%27Creepy%27%20Behavior" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-what-these-celebs-had-to-say-about-kevin-spacey-and-his-creepy-behavior.html&description=Here%27s%20What%20These%20Celebs%20Had%20To%20Say%20About%20Kevin%20Spacey%20And%20His%20%27Creepy%27%20Behavior" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./hillary-clinton-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hillary Clinton Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gus-dapperton-wiki-biography-height-age-who-girlfriend-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gus Dapperton Wiki, Biography, Height, Age, Who, Girlfriend, Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
