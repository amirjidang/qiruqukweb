The two step-siblings have been seen out and about together a few times.</p><p>The two are about the same age and seem to have much in common, including their style. The couple of times they've been spotted, both have been seen in relatively similar things. They both have short hair and wear oversize shirts and trousers.</p><p>As if their being in public doesn't solidify their friendship, they've been seen holding hands while laughing and listening to music together.

"Like, my best year, I think, since my kids were born."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Jennifer Lopez And Josh Duhamel Really Felt About Working With Each Other In Shotgun Wedding</a></span></p><p>Lopez continued when speaking about her and Affleck's family, saying, "We moved in together. The kids moved in together. It's been, like, a really kind of emotional transition, but at the same time, all your dreams coming true."</p><p>While speaking with <a href=#>Vogue Magazine</a>, Lopez said, "What I hope to cultivate with our family is that his kids have a new ally in me, and my kids have a new ally in him, someone who really loves and cares about them but can have a different perspective and help me see things that I can't see with my kids because I'm so emotionally tied up."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The families seem to be getting along, the children even wanting to hang out without their parents, "one of my kids said, 'I want to go to the flea market.' I was like, 'Oh, you want me and Ben to come?' They said, 'You know, it's such a thing when you go, Mom.'"</p><p>Lopez recalls being hurt by her kids not wanting to hang out with her and Ben, but she understands. The star says, "I get it. They want time with their friends when they aren't being watched and followed and photographed. It's a thing. Nobody's complaining, but it's a thing."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez Has Spent An Insane Amount Of Money On Her Exes, Whether She Wanted To Or Not</a></span></p><p>But, she reiterates, "The transition is a process that needs to be handled with so much care," she says.

And, while speaking about Garner, she says she is "an amazing co-parent, and they [Affleck and Garner] work really well together."</p><p>A source close to Lopez and Affleck told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>, "Marc Anthony and Jen Garner have been supportive. There's been no bad blood or hard feelings as of late."</p><p>The source continued, "their main goal is to always keep their children happy, and they all feel aligned on that.

"When we reconnected, those feelings for me were still very real. All we've ever wanted was to kind of come to a place of peace in our lives where we really felt that type of love that you feel when you're very young and wonder if you can have that again."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmopWju6qyxKtkpaegmsdurc2dZJudnmKup7LLnpqkq12gtqW%2FjJ6kpp1dlruledKeqZqomJ67ons%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-jennifer-lopez-and-ben-afflecks-kids-emme-and-seraphina.html&text=What%20Happened%20Between%20Jennifer%20Lopez%20And%20Ben%20Affleck%27s%20Kids%2c%20Emme%20And%20Seraphina%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-between-jennifer-lopez-and-ben-afflecks-kids-emme-and-seraphina.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-jennifer-lopez-and-ben-afflecks-kids-emme-and-seraphina.html&title=What%20Happened%20Between%20Jennifer%20Lopez%20And%20Ben%20Affleck%27s%20Kids%2c%20Emme%20And%20Seraphina%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-jennifer-lopez-and-ben-afflecks-kids-emme-and-seraphina.html&title=What%20Happened%20Between%20Jennifer%20Lopez%20And%20Ben%20Affleck%27s%20Kids%2c%20Emme%20And%20Seraphina%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-jennifer-lopez-and-ben-afflecks-kids-emme-and-seraphina.html&title=What%20Happened%20Between%20Jennifer%20Lopez%20And%20Ben%20Affleck%27s%20Kids%2c%20Emme%20And%20Seraphina%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-jennifer-lopez-and-ben-afflecks-kids-emme-and-seraphina.html&description=What%20Happened%20Between%20Jennifer%20Lopez%20And%20Ben%20Affleck%27s%20Kids%2c%20Emme%20And%20Seraphina%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-love-islands-arabella-chi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To 'Love Island's' Arabella Chi?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-did-jim-parsons-do-on-his-first-date-with-husband-todd-spiewak.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Did Jim Parsons Do On His First Date With Husband Todd Spiewak?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
