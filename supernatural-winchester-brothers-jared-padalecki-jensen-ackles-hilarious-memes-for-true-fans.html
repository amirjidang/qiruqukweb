We gathered up a list of 10 famous and hilarious memes that you will love, especially if you've been a fan of these two for a while now!</p><h2 id=the-what-are-you-doing-with-your-life-meme>The "What are you doing with your life" Meme</h2><p>We recognize the hilarious faces the character played by Jensen has made throughout the 15 seasons of the show. We've seen him mad, sad and funny, so this meme couldn't be more relatable. It truly depicts what we feel from time to time, right?</p><p>The bottom line is that we might not know where our life is going and maybe we don't have everything figured out, but we have to maintain the same optimism that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dean</a> is embracing the life with, right?</p><h2 id=the-apocalypse>The Apocalypse</h2><p>If you're familiar with Supernatural and the infamous movie 2012, then you probably know why this meme is so relatable and funny at the same time. It was believed that the end is near and that not only will bring the world to an end but also make it completely devastating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Keanu Reeves Memes That Are Too Hilarious For Words</a></span></p><p>We've seen Sam and Dean facing so many intricate situations before, facing God, the Devil and stopping so many evil creatures,&nbsp;so why not believe that they may have saved our earth= That's some sort of food for thought, right?</p><h2 id=he-will-never-have-a-girlfriend-meme>He Will Never Have a Girlfriend Meme</h2><p>Another reason we completely adore this show (and the actors <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jensen</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jared</a>), is&nbsp;due to the incredible facial features both actors have. They are handsome and extremely charismatic, and that is why this meme is hilarious.</p><p>Truth being said, we believe that Jensen was a very cute baby but he grew up to be talented and handsome at the same time and we couldn't be more grateful for having him on our screens for more than 15 years now! Needless to say, he ended up being adored by the ladies and married beautiful Danneel Harris in 2010.</p><h2 id=the-family-photo-meme>The family photo meme</h2><p>This particular meme includes&nbsp;Misha Collins, another important&nbsp;actor&nbsp;on the show that plays Castiel. These three have been some sort of magical trio throughout the show and have been together in both funny and dangerous situations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They either had to pretend they are relatives, they had to fight one another, due to various celestial reasons or even had to drift apart for some seasons. We admit that there is no Sam without Dean and Castiel, no Dean without his 2 peers and Castiel wouldn't learn how to be "human" if it weren't for his two partners!</p><h2 id=the-appreciation-look>The Appreciation Look</h2><p>Yes! Yes! We all love and admire these two and it is heartwarming to see how much respect and appreciation they have for each other! Every time there is an opportunity, we have noticed that they show their full support, both by words and looks!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Most Memeable Photos Of Jared Padalecki</a></span></p><p>Just look at how this cute meme depicts the fans' feelings that go towards Jared&nbsp;Padalecki. Supporters love seeing them and hearing them talk, so the picture above is 100% true!</p><h2 id=the-pie-meme>The Pie Meme</h2><p>If you've seen Supernatural, you are most likely used to Dean's particular appreciation for pie. The famous lines, such as "Love me some pie" or "I read pie, I love pie, the rest is just blah, blah, blah" are both funny and relatable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who doesn't love pie? Exactly, almost everyone does. According to Dean, even when it comes to&nbsp;somebody's anniversary - there should always be pie on the table.</p><h2 id=the-gilmore-girls-meme>The Gilmore Girls Meme</h2><p>If you grew up watching the Gilmore Girls&nbsp;and right after that you noticed that the character Sam, played by&nbsp;Jared Padalecki looks extremely familiar, that is because he played Dean (funny how his brothers' name in the show Supernatural was Dean right after - coincidence?) - Rory's boyfriend.</p><p>This meme is so funny because it integrates two shows and the fans of Supernatural couldn't relate more. And after 15 seasons of this amazing TV-show, we can only agree with this GIF - The show is a lifestyle indeed, a religion we may add and if someone's a fan of this type of shows and didn't get a chance to watch it yet, this is your sign!</p><h2 id=the-salt-bae-meme>The Salt Bae Meme</h2><p>Another superb integration of a meme into the life of Jensen and Jared! The infamous Salt Bae guy is used here to depict how well we've learned how to use our "supernatural" skills after watching so many episodes where they fight the evil.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We must say we are prepared for everything that may come and perhaps we will be able to use one or two tips they have given, when the lights flicker or when we see a weird shadow - but fingers crossed that won't happen anytime soon. Anyhow, it is interesting to realize that a series that approaches a dark fantasy genre can have such a realistic input in our lives, and all of this thanks to the wonderful <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actors</a>!</p><h2 id=the-look>The Look</h2><p>Jared Padalecki is happily married to his former colleague from the show Supernatural,&nbsp;Genevieve Cortese and they have three beautiful children together -&nbsp;Odette Elliott Padalecki, Austin Shepherd Padalecki, and Thomas Colton Padalecki. And truth be told, when your dad is this handsome, talented, hard-working celebrity, how can you possibly not look at him this way?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Every Cast Member Of Supernatural's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>We definitely relate to Odette Elliott as this is how Jared's true fans would probably look at him too! With that being said, it shows what a great person and dad the actor is as well as an inspiration for all of his supporters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-list>The List</h2><p>Yes, we've already concluded that Jensen Ackles is truly a symbol when it comes to handsomeness. It's not us who's telling it, but all the memes we have found while&nbsp;surfing on the World Wide Web.</p><p>A recurrent joke is that the perfect man has to be handsome, tall, funny, has beautiful big eyes, an amazing smile and that he must look like Jensen Ackles. Ladies? Have you found your Jensen yet? If not, don't worry, there is no actual standard when it comes to beauty, as we have to admit that it lies only in the eyes of the beholder.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Memes That Made People Rich</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5no6q9pr7NmquuqpGheri1zZyfnqukmr9urtGoq6Gdoqh6q63RnptmqJGZrq2xwqSgZqKVo8CmuoyamqSklah6qbXLmqmip6Woeq6xzJ6qZp6fp3q1vtSeZJ%2BZnqh8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsupernatural-winchester-brothers-jared-padalecki-jensen-ackles-hilarious-memes-for-true-fans.html&text=10%20Hilarious%20Jared%20Padalecki%20and%20Jensen%20Ackles%20Memes%20Only%20Fans%20Would%20Understand&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsupernatural-winchester-brothers-jared-padalecki-jensen-ackles-hilarious-memes-for-true-fans.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsupernatural-winchester-brothers-jared-padalecki-jensen-ackles-hilarious-memes-for-true-fans.html&title=10%20Hilarious%20Jared%20Padalecki%20and%20Jensen%20Ackles%20Memes%20Only%20Fans%20Would%20Understand" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsupernatural-winchester-brothers-jared-padalecki-jensen-ackles-hilarious-memes-for-true-fans.html&title=10%20Hilarious%20Jared%20Padalecki%20and%20Jensen%20Ackles%20Memes%20Only%20Fans%20Would%20Understand" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsupernatural-winchester-brothers-jared-padalecki-jensen-ackles-hilarious-memes-for-true-fans.html&title=10%20Hilarious%20Jared%20Padalecki%20and%20Jensen%20Ackles%20Memes%20Only%20Fans%20Would%20Understand" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsupernatural-winchester-brothers-jared-padalecki-jensen-ackles-hilarious-memes-for-true-fans.html&description=10%20Hilarious%20Jared%20Padalecki%20and%20Jensen%20Ackles%20Memes%20Only%20Fans%20Would%20Understand" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10-of-the-most-overpaid-athletes-in-sports.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Of The Most Overpaid Athletes In Sports">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10-celebrities-who-built-multi-billion-dollar-brands.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Celebrities Who Built Multi-Billion-Dollar Brands">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
