Especially considering that the couple are known for valuing their privacy, and <a href=#>not sharing details about their intimacy</a> unless absolutely necessary. The rumors are usually meaningless and fade quickly. This time, though, it seemed people were convinced they had broken up for good. The proof? The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actress had unfollowed him on Instagram</a>. That could be mildly suspicious, if Zendaya hadn't unfollowed literally everyone after announcing several projects for this year, a PR move that many big stars do.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_zendaya-s-insane-movie-and-tv-show-salaries-have-changed-her-net-worth-forever_bk_a1-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Zendaya's Movie And TV Show Salaries Have Increased Her Net Worth Drastically">Zendaya's Movie And TV Show Salaries Have Increased Her Net Worth Drastically</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Shows like Zapped and HBO's Euphoria, as well as blockbusters like Spider-Man: No Way Home and Dune, have made Zendaya a very rich woman.</p><p>So, of course, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor was fed up with everyone speculating about his love life</a>, and when he was finally asked if they had split up, he sternly replied <strong>"absolutely not"</strong>. Being one of Hollywood's most beloved couples, this answer was great news for a lot of people. But then, when Tom Holland showed up solo at the 2024 Critics Choice Awards only a day after denying the rumors, it raised questions again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-holland-feels-39-secure-and-happy-39>Tom Holland Feels 'Secure And Happy'</h2><span class=txt>Close</span><p>It shouldn't have been a surprise that Zendaya wasn't with Tom on the red carpet of the Critics Choice Awards. After all, they haven't walked red carpets together throughout their relationship unless it was a project they were both a part of. Maybe not to steal each other's spotlight? Who knows... But of course, after the rumors, it did raise some questions. Tom Holland wasn't bothered, though. In fact, he was in very high spirits, hopeful not only about the present but also the future. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He said he's excited about new projects</a> and that he's <strong>"very creatively driven to sort of do some new things and push myself in ways I didn't think I could."</strong> He has <strong>"a few things under the radar"</strong> that he's not ready to share yet, but judging by how he shared the news, they will probably be very exciting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Outside of his career, the actor also shared a little snippet of his personal life. Nothing concrete, of course, but he did express that he feels <strong>"very secure and happy, and I'm enjoying life".</strong></p><p>With their relationship apparently going strong, Zendaya's upcoming projects such as Challengers and Dune: Part Two, and Tom Holland's exciting next step in his acting career, it's safe to say that this celebrity power couple is living one of their best moments, and no petty rumors could change that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdnbytuMCnm2aqlaHCpMDAp6tmmZKkwrV5xa6rrqqVYr2zu8memq2rXafCrrvRrGSznZ6ZrrqtjJupnpmbqr1w</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftom-holland-reluctant-about-future-projects-rumors-zendaya-breakup.html&text=Tom%20Holland%20Is%20Reluctant%20To%20Talk%20About%20Future%20Projects%20Amidst%20Rumors%20That%20He%20And%20Zendaya%20Broke%20Up&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftom-holland-reluctant-about-future-projects-rumors-zendaya-breakup.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftom-holland-reluctant-about-future-projects-rumors-zendaya-breakup.html&title=Tom%20Holland%20Is%20Reluctant%20To%20Talk%20About%20Future%20Projects%20Amidst%20Rumors%20That%20He%20And%20Zendaya%20Broke%20Up" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftom-holland-reluctant-about-future-projects-rumors-zendaya-breakup.html&title=Tom%20Holland%20Is%20Reluctant%20To%20Talk%20About%20Future%20Projects%20Amidst%20Rumors%20That%20He%20And%20Zendaya%20Broke%20Up" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftom-holland-reluctant-about-future-projects-rumors-zendaya-breakup.html&title=Tom%20Holland%20Is%20Reluctant%20To%20Talk%20About%20Future%20Projects%20Amidst%20Rumors%20That%20He%20And%20Zendaya%20Broke%20Up" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftom-holland-reluctant-about-future-projects-rumors-zendaya-breakup.html&description=Tom%20Holland%20Is%20Reluctant%20To%20Talk%20About%20Future%20Projects%20Amidst%20Rumors%20That%20He%20And%20Zendaya%20Broke%20Up" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./travis-van-winkle-girlfriend-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Travis Van Winkle: Girlfriend, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body facts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-are-jeff-bezos-kids-with-mackenzie-scott.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="There's An Explanation For Why Jeff Bezos' Kids Are Anonymous (And His Fiance's Son Is All Over So">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
