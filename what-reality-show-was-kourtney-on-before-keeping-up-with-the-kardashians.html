However, as the show first aired when she was 28 years old, there is a lot Kourtney did in those years prior to becoming a reality TV star.</p><p>Kourtney is the <a href=#>only Kardashian sister to have gone to college</a>, the only other sibling being Rob who went to South Carolina's Marshall School of Business. She went to the University of Arizona and graduated with a degree in theatre arts and a minor in Spanish.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Rob Kardashian Didn't Attend Kourtney Kardashian And Travis Barker's Wedding</a></span></p><p>This may come as a surprise to fans as during the first few seasons of KUWTK, there was a lot of focus on the sisters' businesses, so some may have thought that she would have studied a business major or something along those lines.</p><p>Those who watched the first few seasons of KUWTK might remember her and Kris Jenner's children's boutique store, Smooch, which had multiple stores across Los Angeles and New York City.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-04-02.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, what <a href=#>fans of the Kardashian sister also may not know</a> is that she did actually put her theatre arts degree to good use, having starred in the soap opera One Life To Live, playing the role of an attorney. But despite her degree, the reviews of her acting weren't the best, and she hasn't been seen to do an acting role since.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Something Isn't Quite Right With Kourtney Kardashian And Travis Barker's Relationship</a></span></p><p>Kourtney also had other experience working in TV, although this time it was behind the camera, as she was a production assistant. This meant that she would help out a lot on the sets of many TV shows, so she at least got to see what working in TV was like before deciding to step in front of the camera.</p><h2 id=did-kourtney-kardashian-star-in-any-tv-shows-before-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians>Did Kourtney Kardashian Star In Any TV Shows Before Keeping Up With The Kardashians?</h2><p>Given that whenever most people hear the name 'Kardashian', their first thought is likely to be about their TV show, it's hard to imagine any of them appearing in anything else other than their own shows. Especially Kourtney, as she is one of the siblings that appears to like the spotlight the least.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Two years prior to the first episode of KUWTK airing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kourtney starred in another reality TV show</a> called Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive, which featured the children of various celebrities, and the purpose of the show was for them to learn how to live a simple life without any of the luxuries they were used to.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kourtney-kardashian-filthy-rich-cattle-drive.jpg><p>In her first clips on the show, Kourtney was seen talking to the camera, saying that she doesn't like spending time outdoors and couldn't understand why she had decided to leave her house to sleep outside in a tent for three weeks and ride horses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kourtney and the other contestants were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">given various tasks to do</a> during their time on the show, which Kourtney appeared to struggle with. However, in typical Kardashian style, it was definitely fashion over practicality, as she was also seen saying to the camera that it's important to look cute whilst out riding or doing anything else.</p><p>Despite the success of KUWTK having twenty seasons and various spin-off shows, including their new season The Kardashians on Hulu and Disney+, this TV show was not met with the same success and was actually canceled after a mere eight episodes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kourtney Used To Hate Filming Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a></span></p><p>However, whilst the show may not have been a success, Kourtney did at least donate any money that she made from appearing on the show to charity; so at least there was at least one benefit from her appearance on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What may also be surprising is that Kourtney was the first of the Kardashian siblings to appear on a reality TV show. Given that she no longer appears to enjoy the spotlight as much and the fact that her sister Kim always seemed much more interested in becoming a celebrity, while this is true, it still seems pretty unbelievable.</p><p>Having said that, it is alleged that it was actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">meant to be Kim appearing on the show</a> initially and not Kourtney, which brings about the question of why Kim didn't appear on the show and why Kourtney took her place.</p><h2 id=what-else-is-kourtney-kardashian-up-to>What Else Is Kourtney Kardashian Up To?</h2><p>These days, not only is Kourtney still filming for her family's latest show, The Kardashians, but she is also up to a whole matter of other things, including working on her own business website, <a href=#>Poosh</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Kourtney-Kardashian-Kylie-Jenner-YouTube.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She is also busy being a working Mom and having <a href=#>recently married Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker</a>, she is very much still in the stages of being blissfully married and is loving life with her new husband.</p><p>Whilst <a href=#>reality TV doesn't seem to be her main priority</a> these days, other than appearing on her family's show, who knows whether Kourtney will appear in another reality TV show ever again?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr%2Bmrcuiq7Jlo528uHnWmqpmo5%2Bqv7W6xLJkqKZdl7Knu9GeZKSdlaW2r7OMrqdmr5mptW7Ax55kpJmima60tMiapaxn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-reality-show-was-kourtney-on-before-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians.html&text=Kourtney%20Kardashian%27s%20First%20Reality%20TV%20Appearance%20%28Before%20KUWTK%29%20Was%20A%20Major%20Flop&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-reality-show-was-kourtney-on-before-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-reality-show-was-kourtney-on-before-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians.html&title=Kourtney%20Kardashian%27s%20First%20Reality%20TV%20Appearance%20%28Before%20KUWTK%29%20Was%20A%20Major%20Flop" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-reality-show-was-kourtney-on-before-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians.html&title=Kourtney%20Kardashian%27s%20First%20Reality%20TV%20Appearance%20%28Before%20KUWTK%29%20Was%20A%20Major%20Flop" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-reality-show-was-kourtney-on-before-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians.html&title=Kourtney%20Kardashian%27s%20First%20Reality%20TV%20Appearance%20%28Before%20KUWTK%29%20Was%20A%20Major%20Flop" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-reality-show-was-kourtney-on-before-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians.html&description=Kourtney%20Kardashian%27s%20First%20Reality%20TV%20Appearance%20%28Before%20KUWTK%29%20Was%20A%20Major%20Flop" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./larry-david-net-worth-curb-your-enthusiasm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Larry David's Definitive Net Worth: The Truth About The Fortune The Curb Star Refuses To Talk About ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kayla-nicole-jones-divorce-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kayla Nicole Jones Divorce: She Announced On Instagram">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
