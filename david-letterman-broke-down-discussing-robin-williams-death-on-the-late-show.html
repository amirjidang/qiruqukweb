According to Letterman's executive producer Rob Burnett, planning the episode was a tough task.</p><p>“When you do a nightly show for decades, you think you’ve dealt with every possibility, every eventuality. And here was something completely brand new and no one knew what to do. I think part of the healing process was this desire to return to normalcy. That was a small part of what we could provide.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>David Letterman Asked Billie Eilish If She Wanted To Stop Her Interview After She Started To Twitch Because Of Her Tourettes Syndrome</a></span></p><p>As expected, the emotional Letterman did a great job during his opening monologue, which was different compared to his normal work which sees laughter from the audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Letterman said, “My hope for myself and for everybody else, not only in New York but everywhere is that we never, ever take these people for granted."</p><p>“If you didn’t believe it before, you can absolutely believe it now. New York City is the greatest city in the world,” Letterman continued.</p><p>It was a powerful moment in late night history, and fans are thankful the host brought back some normalcy during a difficult period.</p><h2 id=david-letterman-broke-down-during-his-final-words-discussing-robin-williams-39-struggles>David Letterman Broke Down During His Final Words Discussing Robin Williams' Struggles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/your-paragraph-text-2023-07-07t191301-260.png><p>During his tribute to Robin Williams, Letterman went back in time discussing the first time he had met the comedian, and how he was completely blown away by his style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Letterman revealed during the tribute, "All of a sudden, he comes up on stage and you know what it is. It's like nothing we had ever seen before. Nothing we had ever imagined before. We go home at night and are writing our little jokes about stuff. And this guy comes in and we're like a morning dew, he comes in like a hurricane."</p><p>Letterman went on to reveal that he really got to know Williams in the later years when he'd come on the show to promote his films. Clearly, Williams became an iconic symbol for the Late Show, and Letterman was overcome with emotions during his final thoughts after the video tribute aired.</p><p>Letterman said, "God bless you, my friend. Well, what I will add here is beyond being a very talented man and a good friend and a gentlemen, I'm sorry. Like everybody else, I had no idea that the man was in pain, that the man was suffering. But what a guy. Robin Williams.

As expected, thousands of comments came in, both praising Dave for how he handled it, and Robin Williams on such an exceptional career and legacy.</p><p>One fan writes, "It's been 8 years and 2022 is almost ending and I still miss him and he is still one of a kind. Many celebrities of my childhood have died but his is the only one I have cried over."</p><p>Another person writes, "Dave at his 3rd most emotional, after 9/11 and introducing the heart team. And I'm grateful for the use of the actual Cast Away music. RIP Mr. Williams."</p><p>"I love Dave and Robin. Robin's death had a profound effect on me. Some of the funniest people struggle with depression. It's a great cover up.
