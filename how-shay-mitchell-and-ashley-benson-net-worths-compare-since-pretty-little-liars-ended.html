In case you ever wondered whether Shay Mitchell or Ashley Benson has a higher net worth — keep on scrolling to find out!</p><h2 id=both-ladies-rose-to-fame-on-the-teen-mystery-drama-39-pretty-little-liars-39><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Both Ladies Rose To Fame On The Teen Mystery Drama 'Pretty Little Liars'</span></h2><p>We're kicking the list off with the fact that while both Ashley Benson and Shay Mitchell had some experience in the industry prior to Pretty Little Liars, it was certainly the show that helped them achieve international fame. In the ABC Family/Freeform teen drama, <a href=#>Ashley Benson</a> played Hanna Marin while Shay Mitchell portrayed Emily Fields. The show premiered in 2010, and after seven seasons it wrapped up in 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=since-the-show-wrapped-up-benson-appeared-in-two-movies><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Since The Show Wrapped Up, Benson Appeared In Two Movies</span></h2><p>Since 2017, fans got to see Ashley Benson in two movies. She portrayed Roxie Rotten in the 2018 drama movie Her Smell which currently has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">5.8 rating</a> on IMDb. This year, fans got to see her as Tracey in the crime thriller movie The Birthday Cake which has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">4.3 rating</a> on IMDb. Currently, Ashley Benson has one upcoming project — the short movie Ask Me If I Care.</p><h2 id=while-mitchell-appeared-in-only-one><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>While Mitchell Appeared In Only One</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Ashley Benson wasn't too busy with movie roles since Pretty Little Liars wrapped up — neither was Shay Mitchell.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About The New Cast Of The ‘Pretty Little Liars’ Reboot</a></span></p><p>In fact, the actress appeared in only one movie since 2017, the supernatural horror thriller The Possession of Hannah Grace. The movie was released in 2018 and it currently has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">5.2 rating</a> on IMDb. In it, <a href=#>Shay Mitchell</a> played Megan Reed.</p><h2 id=however-benson-hasn-39-t-appeared-in-any-shows><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>However, Benson Hasn't Appeared In Any Shows</span></h2><p>Considering that the two ladies haven't appeared in too many movies since Pretty Little Liars ended, one would think that they worked on multiple shows instead. However, Ashley Benson seems to have taken things rather slowly as the actress hasn't appeared in one television project since the teen drama wrapped up in 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=while-mitchell-worked-on-three><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>While Mitchell Worked On Three</span></h2><p>After Pretty Little Liars wrapped up, Shay Mitchell appeared in two very famous shows. In 2018 fans could see the actress portray Peach Salinger in the first season of the psychological thriller show You and since 2019 she's been playing Stella Cole in the comedy show Dollface. Besides these two, Mitchell also appeared as herself in an episode of <a href=#>RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars</a> and Almost Ready. This year, fans could hear the actress's voice in the anime-influenced shoe Trese in which she is the voice behind Alexandra Trese.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=both-actresses-are-no-strangers-to-brand-endorsements><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Both Actresses Are No Strangers To Brand Endorsements</span></h2><p>Another source of income for both actresses are surely brand deals. Over the years they collaborated with plenty of brands to promote their products. Mitchell worked with brands like Pantene, American Eagle Outfitters, Acuvue, and Bioré while Ashley Benson recently collaborated with the brand Hempz.</p><h2 id=and-they-also-ventured-into-owning-businesses><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>And They Also Ventured Into Owning Businesses</span></h2><p>Besides working with famous brands, both ladies ventured into starting their own businesses too. Shay Mitchell founded the production company Amore & Vita Inc., the travel brand BÉIS, as well as the tequila seltzer brand Onda.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Lucy Hale Keep In Touch With Any Of Her ‘Pretty Little Liar’ Co-Stars?</a></span></p><p>Ashley Benson launched an eyewear capsule collection with Privé Revaux, as well as a fashion app called Daily Vice.</p><h2 id=shay-mitchell-has-a-bigger-social-media-following><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Shay Mitchell Has A Bigger Social Media Following</span></h2><p>While both ladies managed to remain famous after Pretty Little Liars wrapped up, it seems as if Shay Mitchell is slightly more popular. Currently, Mitchell has 31.2 million followers on Instagram while Benson has 21.9 million. However, on Twitter, Mitchell currently has 3 million followers while Benson has 3.9 million. On TikTok, Mitchell has 6.4 million followers while Benson only has about 600,000 followers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashley-benson-currently-has-a-net-worth-of-6-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ashley Benson Currently Has A Net Worth Of $6 Million</span></h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Ashley Benson is currently estimated to have a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$6 million</a>. A majority of the star's income comes from acting but some part of it also comes from social media and brand endorsements. However, it's safe to say that most of Ashley Benson's net worth comes from being on Pretty Little Liars for seven years.</p><h2 id=and-so-does-shay-mitchell><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>And So Does Shay Mitchell</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it may seem as if Shay Mitchels is slightly more successful today, according to Celebrity Net Worth, the actress is also estimated to have a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$6 million</a>. Mitchell has a couple of very successful businesses so her net worth is bound to grow in the future, but for now, it seems as if the majority of her wealth still comes from Pretty Little Liars.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Cast Of 'Mean Girls': Is Everyone Busy With Work In 2021?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dqLWixYymoK2bmJq5rXnAp5tmmaOduabFjJucp6ufo3qvsdNmrqiqpJ3Abq%2FOpqeaqpViwKq6wp5kqaqVqcG6ecuiq62klWK5qq3RrGSeppSasXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-shay-mitchell-and-ashley-benson-net-worths-compare-since-pretty-little-liars-ended.html&text=How%20Shay%20Mitchell%27s%20And%20Ashley%20Benson%27s%20Net%20Worths%20Compare%20Since%20%27Pretty%20Little%20Liars%27%20Ended&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-shay-mitchell-and-ashley-benson-net-worths-compare-since-pretty-little-liars-ended.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-shay-mitchell-and-ashley-benson-net-worths-compare-since-pretty-little-liars-ended.html&title=How%20Shay%20Mitchell%27s%20And%20Ashley%20Benson%27s%20Net%20Worths%20Compare%20Since%20%27Pretty%20Little%20Liars%27%20Ended" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-shay-mitchell-and-ashley-benson-net-worths-compare-since-pretty-little-liars-ended.html&title=How%20Shay%20Mitchell%27s%20And%20Ashley%20Benson%27s%20Net%20Worths%20Compare%20Since%20%27Pretty%20Little%20Liars%27%20Ended" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-shay-mitchell-and-ashley-benson-net-worths-compare-since-pretty-little-liars-ended.html&title=How%20Shay%20Mitchell%27s%20And%20Ashley%20Benson%27s%20Net%20Worths%20Compare%20Since%20%27Pretty%20Little%20Liars%27%20Ended" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-shay-mitchell-and-ashley-benson-net-worths-compare-since-pretty-little-liars-ended.html&description=How%20Shay%20Mitchell%27s%20And%20Ashley%20Benson%27s%20Net%20Worths%20Compare%20Since%20%27Pretty%20Little%20Liars%27%20Ended" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1015661-hulk-hogan-wwe-crown-jewel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hulk Hogan Removed From WWE Crown Jewel Advertisement (Updated)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./guy-fieri-weight-loss-how-did-guy-fieri-lose-weight-699571-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Guy Fieri Weight Loss, How Did Guy Fieri Lose Weight?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
