After all, the writers seemingly loved to give his character stories on the A&E Psycho spin-off series and fans absolutely loved drooling over his undeniable good looks. Still, it was Freddie Highmore who became the big star, <a href=#>landing another leading role on a hit network drama</a> and<a href=#> increasing his net worth substantially.</a> Having said that, Max Thieriot is still out there working hard despite fans constantly wondering what happened to his career?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Bates Motel': Fans Still Have This One Uncomfortable Question</a></span></p><p>Because of Max's consistent work ever since he was young, he has been able to amass a pretty impressive net worth that continues to grow each day. He may be currently working on a niche-market show (SEAL Team) but the man is carving out a pretty incredible path for himself. Here's what Max Theriot has been doing since Bates Motel, what his personal life is like, and just how much money he's managed to accumulate...</p><h2 id=max-is-reportedly-worth-a-whopping-2-million>Max Is Reportedly Worth A Whopping $2 Million</h2><p>Given Max's early success, it makes sense that Celebrity Net Worth claims that <a href=#>his net worth is around $2 million</a>. The small-town California native became interested in acting after taking some improv classes as a kid. Due to his talents and good looks he was quickly signed by a manager and started modeling for The Gap. In 2004, Max got his first movie role alongside<a href=#> the somewhat controversial Kristen Stewart</a> in Catch That Kid. Soon Max was everywhere, earning roles in The Pacifier with Vin Deisel (which earned him a nomination for a Young Artist Award), Nancy Drew with Emma Roberts, and Jumper where he played a younger version of Hayden Christensen's character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Freddie Highmore And Dakota Fanning's Relationship</a></span></p><p>Even though the talented young man was getting roles in a lot of kids' projects, more adult-driven directors started casting him in dramatic roles in such films as The Astronaut Farmer and the Amanda Seyfried/Julianne Moore psycho-thriller Chloe. After the Atom Egoyan-directed Chloe was released, Max started getting cast in more and more independent movies. Among them, The Family Tree and Disconnect. But he also became a horror flick legend for a moment, staring in both Wes Craven's My Soul To Take and alongside Jennifer Lawrence in House At The End Of The Street. Without a doubt, this is what got him cast on Bates Motel in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Max was featured in all 50 episodes of the enormously successful Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore suspense drama. In it, he played Norman Bates' troubled half-brother Dylan. The show allowed him to show off perhaps more acting skills than he had up until that point. Of course, it also gave him his most consistent paycheck at the time. While Vera and Freddie undoubtedly made more on the show, Max was also able to earn some money as a director for one of the episodes. This is a talent that Max was able to continue to develop for two episodes of his next show, SEAL Team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Between Bates Motel and SEAL Team, Max Thieriot pretty much fell off the map. And for those who don't watch the David Boreanaz CBS Show (now on Paramount +) it does seem as though Max vanished. But SEAL Team has a following and Max is one of the reasons why.</p><h2 id=max-39-s-fans-love-his-personal-life>Max's Fans Love His Personal Life</h2><p>Aside from the fact that max is uber-talented and total eye-candy on the screen, fans love him because of his personal life. Mainly his relationship with his wife Alexis Murphy and their two sons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Max spends a lot of time adventuring in the outdoors with his sons and it's clear that he's exceptionally close with them. In fact, it appears as though Max is close with a lot of the people in his life, at least that's what's presented on Instagram. But fans can often tell when a celebrity is being authentic or not and Max is nothing but authentic and down-to-earth. He also maintains a cluelessness with his Bates Motel brother, Freddie Highmore, but also with the cast members of SEAL Team who he works out with...and that's the other thing his fans love. While Max has always had a great physique, he had to get into exceptionally good shape for his role as a Navy SEAL. The dude is absolutely ripped!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Max isn't in the mainstream as he once was, the fact is that a show like SEAL Team has a big fanbase and a dedicated one. One that will follow him onto new shows that he will inevitably get when SEAL Team finishes. Fans look forward to seeing where Max will go next and just how much money he will accumulate in the process.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Freddie Highmore's First Girlfriend, Sarah Bolger</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6tLHApWStnZGierTAwKtkppmoYsGptcSroKiso2K7psCMsKarrJhitq%2BvzqacaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-truth-about-seal-team-star-max-thieriots-net-worth-income.html&text=The%20Truth%20About%20%27SEAL%20Team%27%20Star%20Max%20Thieriot%27s%20Net%20Worth%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-truth-about-seal-team-star-max-thieriots-net-worth-income.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-seal-team-star-max-thieriots-net-worth-income.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20%27SEAL%20Team%27%20Star%20Max%20Thieriot%27s%20Net%20Worth%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-truth-about-seal-team-star-max-thieriots-net-worth-income.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20%27SEAL%20Team%27%20Star%20Max%20Thieriot%27s%20Net%20Worth%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-seal-team-star-max-thieriots-net-worth-income.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20%27SEAL%20Team%27%20Star%20Max%20Thieriot%27s%20Net%20Worth%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-truth-about-seal-team-star-max-thieriots-net-worth-income.html&description=The%20Truth%20About%20%27SEAL%20Team%27%20Star%20Max%20Thieriot%27s%20Net%20Worth%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-truth-behind-ryan-reynolds-and-wesley-snipes-relationship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Truth Behind Ryan Reynolds And Wesley Snipes' Relationship">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-happened-between-cole-sprouse-lili-reinhart-relationship-call-her-daddy-comments.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Real Reason Cole Sprouse Can't Stop Talking About Ex Girlfriend Lili Reinhart And Angering The I">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
