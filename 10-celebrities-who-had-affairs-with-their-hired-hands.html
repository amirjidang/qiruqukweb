Sometimes it seems that everyone else knows about your partner’s extramarital affairs before you do, and when it comes to celebrities, sometimes the entire world knows before they do (or at least admit that there is something going on). Celebrities are just like everyone else when it comes to dating and romance, and even though a lot of us put them on high pedestals, they still make mistakes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The one thing that celebrities have that most people do not, is a lot of money. So they use that money to hire assistants, interns, drivers and nannies, to help out with every day chores. Some of them even take it a bit too far, and end up cheating on their spouse with those that they hired. It is unfathomable that that person you hired to take care of your children is now “taking care” of your husband, as well.</p><h2 id=david-beckham-with-his-personal-assistant>10. David Beckham With His Personal Assistant</h2><p>Even the most beautiful of couples aren't immune from the affects of cheating. In 2004, footballer <a title="David Beckham Net Worth" href=#>David Beckham</a> was reportedly unfaithful with Rebecca Loos, who at the time, was his personal assistant. Rebecca came out and told the world about the affair, most likely assuming it would end his marriage to his wife; the former Spice Girl, <a title="Victoria Beckham Net Worth" href=#>Victoria Beckham</a>. The plan seemed to have backfired, because the married couple are closer than ever since the scandal. Victoria appears to be a very devoted and forgiving wife, saying that she forgives him and (despite difficulties), that they have come out “stronger and happier.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=jude-law-with-his-nanny>9. Jude Law With His Nanny</h2><p><a title="Jude Law Net Worth" href=#>Jude Law</a> and <a title="Sienna Miller Net Worth" href=#>Sienna Miller</a> met in 2003, and got engaged shortly after. During the engagement, Jude reportedly had an affair with his children’s nanny, Daisy Wright. The public found out this startling bit of news, after Daisy received money from a British tabloid to publish the story. The engagement did not last for very long after the discovery. The nanny eventually apologized to Sienna, but the damage was already done and the engagement was called off less than a year later.</p><p></p><h2 id=charlie-sheen-with-his-assistant>8. Charlie Sheen With His Assistant</h2><p><a title="Charlie Sheen Net Worth" href=#>Charlie Sheen</a> is not very well known for his high fidelity rate when it comes to being faithful to his girlfriends. Nor has he ever shown true dedication to any of his three former wives, including his second wife, <a title="Denise Richards Net Worth" href=#>Denise Richards</a>, whom he had met while filming <i>Good Advice,</i> in 2000. Denise filed for divorce after about four years of marriage and having two daughters together. She claimed it was because of alcohol and drug abuse, and had also made the remarks of Charlie threatening violence against her. Those, of course, are very good reasons to divorce but to make matters worse, he had slept with his assistant while still being married to Denise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=john-edwards-with-a-former-campaign-worker>7. John Edwards With A Former Campaign Worker</h2><p>Senator John Edwards was receiving funds for his campaign to run for president back in 2008, when he was found to be cheating on his wife, who just so happened to be dying of breast cancer. The former Senator admitted to having extramarital contact with a woman who was hired to work for his presidential campaign. To make matters worse, the mistress and John had a baby together, even though he denied it, until paternity tests proved that the baby was, in fact, belonging to John. He was accused for using money from his campaign to cover up the affair, as it would have been really bad for publicity, but was never found guilty of it in a court of law. His wife, Elizabeth, died of breast cancer in 2010.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jon-gosselin-with-the-nanny>6. Jon Gosselin With The Nanny</h2><p><a title="Jon Gosselin Net Worth" href=#>Jon Gosselin</a> was married to <a title="Kate Gosselin Net Worth" href=#>Kate Kreider</a> in 1999, and ended up having eight children together. They had twin girls in 2001, and after deciding to have a third child, Kate ended up giving birth to sextuplets in 2004. This was big news at the time, and after the couple gained a lot of media attention, they ended up with their own television show, Jon & Kate Plus 8. Being thrown into celebrity status sometimes creates a lot of problems for some people, especially when they are not used to being in the limelight. According to Jon and Kate’s former nanny of only one month, Stephanie Santoro, Jon had an illicit affair with her one night, while Kate was away and the children were sleeping. Jon and Kate were divorced soon afterwards. Jon is now in a relationship with Hailey Glassman, who is a 22-year old, and is also the daughter of his ex-wife’s plastic surgeon.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ethan-hawke-cheated-on-uma-thurman-with-the-nanny>5. Ethan Hawke Cheated On Uma Thurman With The Nanny</h2><p>When a wife hires a caregiver to take care of her children, the last thing on their mind should be if her husband can be trusted. <a title="Uma Thurman Net Worth" href=#>Uma Thurman</a> hired Ryan Shawhughes, when she was married to <a title="Ethan Hawke Net Worth" href=#>Ethan Hawke</a>, expecting that she would not have to worry about the two of them when she was away. According to reports, Ethan began an affair with Ryan shortly after she was hired, and now Ethan and Ryan are married and have two children together.&nbsp; It may just be speculation about an actual affair while Ethan was still married to star Uma Thurman, but Ethan did end up marrying Ryan, not too long after his divorce from Uma.&nbsp; He even made a few peculiar statements regarding marriage and fidelity. One statement in particular being, “To act all indignant, that your world has been rocked because your lover wasn't faithful to you, is a little bit like acting rocked that your hair went grey.” He still denies the affair after making those types of statements.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=heidi-klum-with-her-bodyguard>4. Heidi Klum With Her Bodyguard</h2><p>Normally, when we hear about a partner in a marriage being unfaithful, it usually tends to be the husband, but not in the case of <a title="Heidi Klum Net Worth" href=#>Heidi Klum</a> and her bodyguard. Heidi was married to singer, <a title="Seal Net Worth" href=#>Seal</a>, for eight years and had four children, before they settled on a divorce. She is currently dating her bodyguard, Martin Kristen, who she has known for four years. She denies ever being with anyone else while married, although her ex-husband has made several comments contrary to that statement. He accused her of “fornicating with the help before the divorce was final,” implying that she was not faithful to him during their marriage.</p><p></p><h2 id=david-letterman-with-workers-on-his-show>3. David Letterman With Workers On His Show</h2><p>In 2009, <a title="David Letterman Net Worth" href=#>David Letterman</a> was the victim of his producer trying to extort $2 million from him when the producer found out about affairs that David had with multiple females on the show. Instead of paying the extortion fee, David decided to open up publicly and humiliate himself on the air (during his television show), instead. Robert Halderman was the producer of <i>Late Night With David Letterman</i> at the time, and wanted money in exchange for his silence in regards to the many affairs that David had had with his female employees. David did not see this as an option, and told his wife (and the rest of the world) about the affairs he had, and how sorry he was. He “vowed to make it up to his wife”, and they are still together, amidst the previous betrayal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=arnold-schwarzenegger-with-his-housekeeper>2. Arnold Schwarzenegger With His Housekeeper</h2><p><a title="Arnold Schwarzenegger Net Worth" href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, AKA <i>The Terminator</i>, was the governor of California when he was married to&nbsp;<a title="Maria Shriver Net Worth" href=#>Maria Shriver</a>. They seemed to have been the perfect couple, in respect to the public eye. Arnold admitted to Maria that he had multiple affairs throughout the marriage (and at least one <i>before</i> they were married), but the one that people remember the most was the one with his housekeeper. Arnold was involved with Mildred Patricia Baena, while he was still married, and Mildred even had a son after they were together. He denied the fact that he was the father until several years later, when the resemblance was uncanny.&nbsp; He started sending Mildred money for his son (who was born just a week after he and Maria’s fourth child was born) after the housekeeper’s child started to look more and more like Arnold. Maria found out about this, soon after the checks started being sent, and she filed for divorce from Arnold in 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=president-bill-clinton-with-his-intern>1. President Bill Clinton With His Intern</h2><p>Anyone who was around in the late 1990s, had to have been living under a rock if they had not heard about the presidential scandal with the former president, <a title="Bill Clinton Net Worth" href=#>Bill Clinton</a> and his intern, <a title="Monica Lewinsky Net Worth" href=#>Monica Lewinsky</a>. She was a mere 22 years old, working as an intern, hired into the Whitehouse in 1998 to work underneath the president. Monica disclosed the information to a co-worker about the affair, but that co-worker ended up recording the conversations which made it difficult for Monica to deny. At first, the former president denied all of the accusations of an affair with his intern, even stating, “I did not have sexual relations with that woman,” but eventually fessed up. Bill Clinton and his wife, <a title="Hillary Clinton Net Worth" href=#>Hillary</a>, have since worked things out and are still together to this day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2Ysq2xwaugraGVqHq4tM5mn5qcXZazp63Iq6pmr5mptW7Ax56gq2WYnr%2BmsIyhmKeco2Q%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-had-affairs-with-their-hired-hands.html&text=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Had%20Affairs%20With%20Their%20Hired%20Hands&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-celebrities-who-had-affairs-with-their-hired-hands.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-had-affairs-with-their-hired-hands.html&title=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Had%20Affairs%20With%20Their%20Hired%20Hands" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-had-affairs-with-their-hired-hands.html&title=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Had%20Affairs%20With%20Their%20Hired%20Hands" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-had-affairs-with-their-hired-hands.html&title=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Had%20Affairs%20With%20Their%20Hired%20Hands" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-had-affairs-with-their-hired-hands.html&description=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Had%20Affairs%20With%20Their%20Hired%20Hands" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10-of-most-expensive-celebrity-haircuts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Of The Most Expensive Celebrity Haircuts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./90-day-fiance-wife-to-groom-im-going-to-pose-naked-w440372.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'90 Day Fiance' Wife to Groom: I'm Going to Pose Naked">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
