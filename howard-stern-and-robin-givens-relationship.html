In reality, the radio legend has always been far tamer than the character he once played. Since the later part of his college days, Howard has really only had two significant relationships. The first being with Alison Berns, the mother of his three daughters, and the second being with <a href=#>his second and current wife Beth Ostrosky</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>After Howard and Alison's divorce</a> there was really only about a year when Howard played the field. After all, he soon met and fell in love with Beth, who he has been with for over two decades. But during that time, he ended up dating a celebrity shortly after she made an appearance on his show...</p><h2 id=who-did-howard-stern-date>Who Did Howard Stern Date?</h2><p>There are copious casual Howard Stern fans who wonder if something ever went down between him and his longtime co-host, Robin Quivers. Or if Robin was ever in love with her best-friend and colleague. Perhaps this confusion is due to the fact that Howard absolutely did date the similarly named Robin Givens.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Was Robin Quivers In Love With Howard Stern?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For those who don't know Robin Givens is an actor who is best known for her role on the long-running '80s show, Head of Class. Following the success of the series, she had a recurring role in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, was cast on a Toni Braxton music video, made several Tyler Perry movies, and, most recently, had recurring roles on Cw's Riverdale, Katy Keene, and Batwoman.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Will We Ever See The Original 'Wendy Williams Movie' Starring Robin Givens?</a></span></p><p>Of course, when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robin Givens first stopped by The Howard Stern Show in 1999</a>, the radio host had to ask her about her controversial marriage to Mike Tyson. Despite it being ten years since their contentious divorce, lawsuits, and her allegations of his abuse, the topic was more than relevant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Robin Givens filed for divorce in 1988 claiming that Mike Tyson physically abused her and was granted a restraining order against him. Mike Tyson admitted to hitting her in his 1989 biography.</strong></li><li><strong>During their divorce, Mike Tyson accused Robin of stealing millions from him which resulted in her suing him for defamation.</strong></li></ul><p>But Robin Givens' conflict with the acclaimed boxer was far from Howard's main focus during the interview. In fact, it was clear that there was an immediate spark between them.</p><h2 id=howard-stern-and-robin-givens-flirted-during-their-1999-interview-on-his-show>Howard Stern And Robin Givens Flirted During Their 1999 Interview On His Show</h2><p>As soon as Robin Givens walked into Howard's studio, he started gushing over her looks.</p><p>"WOW! Let's get it on," Howard said to her before she even sat down. Then he launched into his first question which had to do with her underwear. But Robin was ready for it. In fact, she seemed to love firing back at Howard and going precisely where he led her. Not only was she game to answer his personal questions, but her playful banter with him was energetic... and flirtatious.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then Robin started to flirt with Howard...</p><p>"You look good," she told him. "No, really, you look really good."</p><p>"I didn't think I was your type."</p><p>"No, you're not my type. But you do look good."</p><p>Then Howard turned to Robin Quivers and said, "You realize that in all the years that we've had this show that I'm not anybody's type?"</p><p>While that may have been true, it turned out not to be accurate when it came to Robin Givens. By the end of the interview, he seemed to prove to be very much her type.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Howard Stern Doesn't Talk About His Divorce On His Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At that time, Howard flirted with most of his celebrity guests. It was part of his shtick. But with Robin, there was a lot of mutual flirting. Shortly after the interview, the two linked up for drinks and dated for a short time prior to Howard meeting Beth.</p><h2 id=robin-givens-says-that-howard-stern-was-a-quot-magnificent-quot-lover>Robin Givens Says That Howard Stern Was A "Magnificent" Lover</h2><p>During <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a 2019 interview on Andy Cohen's Watch What Happens Live</a>, Robin addressed her relationship with Howard as well as his constant self-deprecating joke about his small genitalia. Robin's response to being asked about Howard's true size was simply, "Howard Stern was a magnificent lover. Like unbelievable."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Robin didn't state exactly how long she and Howard dated, she did claim that they were together for "a little while". Other than that, very little is known about their time together. Apart from admitting to dating Robin, Howard hasn't revealed much about what went down between them or why they broke up. However, it seems as though they ended things on positive terms as they've always spoken kindly about each other since their initial meeting on his show in 1999.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>This Is What Howard Stern's Oldest Daughter Is Doing Now</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK%2BRp7Fuv9OeqadlkaOxbr7Om6CnZZeew6a60mapnqSRqbawutKhoKln</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhoward-stern-and-robin-givens-relationship.html&text=Howard%20Stern%20Dated%20This%20Celebrity%20After%20He%20Interviewed%20Her%20On%20His%20Show&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhoward-stern-and-robin-givens-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhoward-stern-and-robin-givens-relationship.html&title=Howard%20Stern%20Dated%20This%20Celebrity%20After%20He%20Interviewed%20Her%20On%20His%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhoward-stern-and-robin-givens-relationship.html&title=Howard%20Stern%20Dated%20This%20Celebrity%20After%20He%20Interviewed%20Her%20On%20His%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhoward-stern-and-robin-givens-relationship.html&title=Howard%20Stern%20Dated%20This%20Celebrity%20After%20He%20Interviewed%20Her%20On%20His%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhoward-stern-and-robin-givens-relationship.html&description=Howard%20Stern%20Dated%20This%20Celebrity%20After%20He%20Interviewed%20Her%20On%20His%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-david-iacono-gay-partner-and-sexuality-who-is-he-dating-in-2022-329620-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is David Iacono Gay?
