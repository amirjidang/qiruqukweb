Supposedly Kidman did not even know about her daughter's wedding. Kidman has had a strained relationship with her adopted children with Cruise for years.</p><p>Because of Nicole Kidman's strained relationship with her daughter Isabella, Kidman might have attended a play instead of her daughter's wedding.</p><h2 id=why-wasn-39-t-nicole-kidman-at-her-daughter-isabella-39-s-wedding>Why Wasn't Nicole Kidman At Her Daughter Isabella's Wedding?</h2><p>Although plenty of <a href=#>celebrities enjoy great relationships with their families</a>, some of them have strained relationships with their children.</p><p>Neither Nicole Kidman nor Tom Cruise were at their daughter Isabella's (also called Bella) wedding. Bella married Max Parker, a British IT consultant, in a secret ceremony in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Isabella-Kidman-Cruise.jpg><p>According to the Daily Mail, it seems the reason <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kidman and Cruise weren't at the wedding</a> wasn't because they were snubbed by their daughter. It was apparently to avoid any attention they might attract from the media.</p><p>A source claimed, "it was decided that neither he (Cruise) nor Nicole should attend as it would have turned the whole event into a circus."</p><p>The source also added, "the animosity between Tom and Nicole was probably a factor."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are conflicting reports about whether The Hours actor knew about the wedding before it took place. According to a source, Kidman helped with wedding planning, and had a private dinner with Bella and Max before the wedding. "Nicole was actually involved with the wedding preparations and she did have a private dinner with Bella and Max. But she didn't go to the ceremony."</p><p>However, according to Page Six, a source stated Nicole wasn't aware her daughter was getting married. "Nicole wasn't there - she didn't even know about it at all."</p><p>Considering the family seems to prefer privacy and doesn't publicly speak about family matters often, it's no surprise there are some rumors surrounding Isabella's wedding. Of course, that could be what Bella wants: some mystery when it comes to her personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-is-nicole-kidman-39-s-relationship-with-isabella-strained>Why Is Nicole Kidman's Relationship With Isabella Strained?</h2><p>It seems any friction between Nicole Kidman and her daughter Isabella Cruise started years ago. When Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman divorced in 2001, their adopted children Isabella and Connor chose to live with their father. They also decided to practice Scientology along with their father. Their mother is not a Scientologist.</p><p>Leah Remini claimed Isabella called her mother "an SP" in her memoir, Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology. An "SP" is a Suppressive Person, a term used in Scientology. Apparently it refers to anyone who does not support the Church of Scientology.</p><p>No matter what has happened between her and her children, Kidman loves and supports them. In an interview with Who, the Nine Perfect Strangers star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discussed her two oldest children</a>. "I know 150 percent that I would give up my life for my children because it's what my purpose is."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Working As A 'Momager' For Her Kids Sunday And Faith Didn't Work Out For Nicole Kidman</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Discussing Isabella and Conner's decision to practice Scientology, Kidman commented, "They are adults. They are able to make their own decisions. They have made choices to be Scientologists and as a mother, it's my job to love them."</p><p>The Big Little Lies actor stated in a previous Vogue interview that she "had chosen not to speak publicly about Scientology. I have two children who are Scientologists - Connor and Isabella - and I utterly respect their beliefs."</p><p>According to the New Zealand Herald, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bella seemed to dismiss any rumors that she and her mother didn't speak</a> to each other. She told New Idea, "Of course [we talk], they're my parents."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/untitled-design-5.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bella was also among the numerous people to like a photo Kidman shared of her wedding to Keith Urban on their 16th wedding anniversary. It seems Bella is looking at her mom's pictures on social media, and is supportive of her mother.</p><h2 id=what-was-nicole-kidman-doing-while-her-daughter-isabella-was-getting-married>What Was Nicole Kidman Doing While Her Daughter Isabella Was Getting Married?</h2><p>Nicole Kidman was in London on the day of Bella's wedding, which took place at the Dorchester Hotel. According to etonline, she did not miss performing in the West End play, Photograph 51, on the same day her daughter got married.</p><p>"While Kidman is in London, performing in the play Photograph 51 at the West End Theater, a source tells ET that she did not miss her show the night of the wedding."</p><p>Even if the Cold Mountain star knew her daughter's wedding was taking place, it seems likely Kidman would have wanted to go ahead and perform that night. Kidman is a professional, and it doesn't make sense that she wouldn't perform because of an event she couldn't attend, even her daughter's wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tom Cruise Paid For His Daughter Isabella's Wedding, But Was Banned From Attending</a></span></p><p>Although <a href=#>Kidman and Bella haven't been seen together</a> in public for years, it's possible that fans of Kidman could see her publicly reunite with her daughter Bella at some point in the future.</p><p>In her interview with Who, Kidman opened up about her love for <a href=#>her children with Cruise</a>. "I am an example of that tolerance and that's what I believe - that no matter what your child does, the child has love and the child has to know there is available love and I'm open here."</p><p>She continued, adding, "That's our job as a parent, to always offer unconditional love."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilopufobJut8idpJqmo2LAtb7AoqWenF2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1uw8itn2aglad6rLXDrGSmoZedwbexjJyYrquVmXqpsdFmq6hlo6C2sXnIrJibnZyhrrR51p6bnaGenHw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnicole-kidmans-strained-relationship-with-her-kids-mightve-caused-her-to-skip-isabellas-wedding.html&text=Nicole%20Kidman%27s%20Strained%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Daughter%20Isabella%20Might%27ve%20Caused%20Her%20To%20Watch%20A%20Play&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnicole-kidmans-strained-relationship-with-her-kids-mightve-caused-her-to-skip-isabellas-wedding.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnicole-kidmans-strained-relationship-with-her-kids-mightve-caused-her-to-skip-isabellas-wedding.html&title=Nicole%20Kidman%27s%20Strained%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Daughter%20Isabella%20Might%27ve%20Caused%20Her%20To%20Watch%20A%20Play" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnicole-kidmans-strained-relationship-with-her-kids-mightve-caused-her-to-skip-isabellas-wedding.html&title=Nicole%20Kidman%27s%20Strained%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Daughter%20Isabella%20Might%27ve%20Caused%20Her%20To%20Watch%20A%20Play" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnicole-kidmans-strained-relationship-with-her-kids-mightve-caused-her-to-skip-isabellas-wedding.html&title=Nicole%20Kidman%27s%20Strained%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Daughter%20Isabella%20Might%27ve%20Caused%20Her%20To%20Watch%20A%20Play" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnicole-kidmans-strained-relationship-with-her-kids-mightve-caused-her-to-skip-isabellas-wedding.html&description=Nicole%20Kidman%27s%20Strained%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Daughter%20Isabella%20Might%27ve%20Caused%20Her%20To%20Watch%20A%20Play" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./p-diddy-arrested-for-assault-on-ucla-coach-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="P.
