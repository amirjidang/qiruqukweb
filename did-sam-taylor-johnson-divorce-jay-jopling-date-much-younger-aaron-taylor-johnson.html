Despite Aaron's busy schedule filming Kick-Ass, Sam, who was going through a divorce with Jay Jopling at the time, invited him to audition at her home.</p><p>"It was so inconvenient," Sam told The Sunday Times UK.

"My friends call him Benjamin Button because he has — on the outside — such youth, and on the inside, he is so wise and settled. He doesn’t like parties. He likes being at home and cooking for the family. He likes walking the dogs. He loves his chickens — he collects the eggs and makes breakfast for everyone. He is an amazing man." Sam told New York Magazine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aaron expressed gratitude to his wife and children during his acceptance speech at the Golden Globes in 2017.

Sam, being older, wealthier, and more established in her career, held a position of authority as Aaron's director when they first met. Their relationship began while working together, although they try to deny it at first.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/th-image-template-6.jpg><p>During a 2012 interview with the Guardian, Aaron was cautious in his response to Sean O'Hagan's question regarding whether they had genuinely developed romantic feelings for each other during filming, saying, "Well, you know, kind of. Maybe. I mean, it must have helped that we already had a brilliant connection as actor and director." Although Aaron mentioned a strong connection as actor and director, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">accounts from the set</a> described a peculiar atmosphere where they appeared infatuated with each other.</p><p>Over time, the couple admitted to a connection during the filming of Nowhere Boy, with Aaron making the first move. Sam revealed that they never went on a date or kissed before Aaron expressed his intention to marry her after the production of Nowhere Boy ended.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When I was on set, I was working so hard that I didn't really have the wherewithal to think about anything else," she says.</p><p>Their relationship blossomed after the completion of the eight-and-a-half-week shoot for the film, but Sam Taylor-Johnson remains tight-lipped about the specifics. While she admits that Aaron's proposal took her by complete surprise, she discloses that he had been planning it for a much longer time than she had anticipated, making the moment incredibly romantic.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Aaron Taylor Johnson Made It Big With These Movies</a></span></p><p>Before tying the knot in 2012, the couple welcomed two daughters, Wylda Rae and Romy Hero. Sam praised Aaron’s contentment with being a stay-at-home dad in an interview with The Guardian, "The great thing about Aaron is that he's happy not working and being at home with the kids while I work."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stacy Lee Kong wrote an article about the couple’s relationship</a> saying that teenagers often develop crushes on adults, and it is Sam’s responsibility not to act on these attractions. Regardless of Aaron's maturity or positive feelings about the relationship, the power dynamics at play make it problematic. Aaron's age alone does not justify or make their relationship acceptable. Young adults can possess autonomy, intelligence, and responsibility, yet still find themselves in relationships with predatory individuals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqK6uedOasKWnomK3sLTNrKanZZSew7C%2Bwp5ko5mpYrewvMuipaBllJbBpnnMrpqhZamkwq%2BzxKtkmpmipLtuwMCyo6iqXZ%2B8qbrSqKVo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-sam-taylor-johnson-divorce-jay-jopling-date-much-younger-aaron-taylor-johnson.html&text=Did%20Sam%20Taylor-Johnson%20Really%20Divorce%20Jay%20Jopling%20Just%20To%20Have%20A%20Relationship%20With%20The%20Much%20Younger%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-sam-taylor-johnson-divorce-jay-jopling-date-much-younger-aaron-taylor-johnson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-sam-taylor-johnson-divorce-jay-jopling-date-much-younger-aaron-taylor-johnson.html&title=Did%20Sam%20Taylor-Johnson%20Really%20Divorce%20Jay%20Jopling%20Just%20To%20Have%20A%20Relationship%20With%20The%20Much%20Younger%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-sam-taylor-johnson-divorce-jay-jopling-date-much-younger-aaron-taylor-johnson.html&title=Did%20Sam%20Taylor-Johnson%20Really%20Divorce%20Jay%20Jopling%20Just%20To%20Have%20A%20Relationship%20With%20The%20Much%20Younger%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-sam-taylor-johnson-divorce-jay-jopling-date-much-younger-aaron-taylor-johnson.html&title=Did%20Sam%20Taylor-Johnson%20Really%20Divorce%20Jay%20Jopling%20Just%20To%20Have%20A%20Relationship%20With%20The%20Much%20Younger%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-sam-taylor-johnson-divorce-jay-jopling-date-much-younger-aaron-taylor-johnson.html&description=Did%20Sam%20Taylor-Johnson%20Really%20Divorce%20Jay%20Jopling%20Just%20To%20Have%20A%20Relationship%20With%20The%20Much%20Younger%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dolly-parton-health-issue-death-hoaxes-is-she-really-sick.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dolly Parton Has Been Plagued By Health Issue Rumors And Death Hoaxes, Here's Whether She's Really S">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./diana-silvers-parents-and-ethnicity-boyfriend-and-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Diana Silvers Parents and Ethnicity  Boyfriend and Instagram">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
