DJ Qualls is a prime example as he appeared early on during the show's run. Qualls was set to appear in ten episodes, but disappeared after one appearance. We'll reveal what took place, and why Qualls wanted off the show. Qualls expressed his disappointment, while fans on Reddit think they found the reason as to why the actor left so quickly.</p><p>In addition, we'll reveal why guest-starring on TBBT was a nightmare for certain actors, according to <strong><a href=#>Kaley Cuoco</a></strong>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:00</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ttweb_kaley-cuoco-s-forgotten-young-sheldon-cameo-had-her-teasing-sheldon-long-before-the-big-bang-theory_bk_a1_v3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kaley Cuoco's Forgotten Young Sheldon Cameo Had Her Teasing Sheldon Long Before The Big Bang Theory</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Kaley Cuoco returned to torment Sheldon in Young Sheldon, but many fans don't remember this moment.</span><h2 id=dj-qualls-cried-the-night-before-his-tbbt-cameo-wishing-it-would-be-canceled>DJ Qualls Cried The Night Before His TBBT Cameo, Wishing It Would Be Canceled</h2><p>We turn back to the early days of The Big Bang Theory. The show was still fresh at this point. DJ Qualls played the role of Toby Loobenfeld during one episode. From a fan perspective, the actor did just fine in his brief role. However, behind the scenes, it seemed like things were very different.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Qualls regretted his Big Bang Theory role</a>, and cried after he accepted it.

And I’ve only taken one job, and I won’t mention it … it was on Big Bang Theory … that I shouldn’t have taken it. That’s not me. That presentational style of acting is so not me. And I took it and regretted, I cried. I cried that night. The day I remember driving to Warner Bros praying to God and I don’t do that, that here would be a fire at Warner Bros and there was! Isn’t that crazy? Don’t f*** with me.

It came down to himself and Jim Parsons. Ultimately, Parsons got the edge to his ability to memorize a script.</p><p>It seems like Qualls wasn't eager to work with Chuck Lorre either. According to a thread on Reddit, Qualls' short stint on TBBT had to do with his broken relationship with Lorre.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/dj-qualls-looking-upset.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Reddit scoop</a> writes, "Yesterday I met DJ Qualls at a comic con while it was slow and we talked for a while.m a huge fan of yours and a huge fan of Big Bang.. and your character was so over the top and made me so uncomfortable, I loved it" He laughed and then told me he was actually supposed to be in 10 episodes.

However, Kaley Cuoco did admit that the gig was a <a href=#>nightmare for even the most established stars</a>. The biggest difficulty was shooting in front of a live audience, something not every actor was used to.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kaley-cuoco-on-the-red-carpet-2-1.jpg><p>Cuoco revealed, "Obviously, my whole life is a sitcom. Especially with Big Bang, ‘cos the cast was like (go go go go go), there was no gap. We’d have these guest stars come on, and some of them were wonderful dramatic actors or whatever, and they would feel so lost for a while. It really is so musical, and you find if you’re one second (out) it can mess up a whole thing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continues, "Because I grew up with it, and I did it for so long, it’s been so natural for me. But I started to see, “This is hard for some people, to find their footing with the audience”. It’s very different if you haven’t done it."</p><p>It took a lot of courage for guest stars to appear on the show, and that was especially true given the obvious chemistry between the cast.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibo2Whqq6tuNJmmaKfXZeur7OMrZ%2Bep6KueqjBxKyrZquklr9ussinmKWkqWLAsbvKnmSipJxirqO71K1kraCVYsCpu9ZmrpqmpJ67qHnOn51mrJiaerS0zrBkmp6kmr9uusign62lkaeybsPEnqJo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdj-qualls-big-bang-theory-guest-star-finally-spoke-ill-about-the-show-wanting-off-the-show-after-nightmare-week.html&text=A%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%20Guest%20Star%20Finally%20Spoke%20Ill%20About%20The%20Show%2c%20Wanting%20Off%20The%20Show%20After%20A%20Nightmar&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdj-qualls-big-bang-theory-guest-star-finally-spoke-ill-about-the-show-wanting-off-the-show-after-nightmare-week.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdj-qualls-big-bang-theory-guest-star-finally-spoke-ill-about-the-show-wanting-off-the-show-after-nightmare-week.html&title=A%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%20Guest%20Star%20Finally%20Spoke%20Ill%20About%20The%20Show%2c%20Wanting%20Off%20The%20Show%20After%20A%20Nightmar" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdj-qualls-big-bang-theory-guest-star-finally-spoke-ill-about-the-show-wanting-off-the-show-after-nightmare-week.html&title=A%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%20Guest%20Star%20Finally%20Spoke%20Ill%20About%20The%20Show%2c%20Wanting%20Off%20The%20Show%20After%20A%20Nightmar" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdj-qualls-big-bang-theory-guest-star-finally-spoke-ill-about-the-show-wanting-off-the-show-after-nightmare-week.html&title=A%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%20Guest%20Star%20Finally%20Spoke%20Ill%20About%20The%20Show%2c%20Wanting%20Off%20The%20Show%20After%20A%20Nightmar" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdj-qualls-big-bang-theory-guest-star-finally-spoke-ill-about-the-show-wanting-off-the-show-after-nightmare-week.html&description=A%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%20Guest%20Star%20Finally%20Spoke%20Ill%20About%20The%20Show%2c%20Wanting%20Off%20The%20Show%20After%20A%20Nightmar" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./amber-rose-on-her-face-tattoos-ignoring-haters.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amber Rose on Her Face Tattoos, Ignoring Haters">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./8-of-the-toughest-wrestlers-ever-and-7-who-are-soft.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="8 Of The Toughest Wrestlers Ever (And 7 Who Are Soft)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
