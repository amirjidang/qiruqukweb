Whether it is a sitcom like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends</a> or a reality show like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bachelor</a>, there is a place for seemingly any type of show out there, but the truth is that only the best and most compelling will find a way to last longer than a few episodes upon their release.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grey’s Anatomy</a> is undoubtedly one of the biggest shows in television history, and at this point, few come close to rivaling its legacy. The original cast of the show was an integral part of it becoming a hit, and through the years, these performers have all made a pretty penny in Hollywood.</p><p>Let’s see who tops the original cast with the highest net worth!</p><h2 id=ellen-pompeo-and-patrick-dempsey-80-million>Ellen Pompeo And Patrick Dempsey $80 Million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/D326A7CB-2FA7-4F45-A73C-FBF178E3AF8A.png><p>Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey&nbsp;remain the two biggest stars in the history of&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy,&nbsp;and while there are plenty of other amazing performers that took part in the show, these two were the primary forces early on. So, it should not be too surprising to see that they are at the top of the pile when comparing the net worths of the original members of the cast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, both Pompeo and Desmpey are currently worth $80 million each. Yes, a lot of their money has come from starring on&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy and from royalties that they earned from the show, but there is far more going on for these performers than just a single show.</p><p>For Ellen Pompeo, the project that she is best known for is&nbsp;Grey’s, but the performer has earned money from other things through the years. She has appeared in projects on the big and small screen like&nbsp;Catch Me If You Can,&nbsp;Old School,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Station 19. Yes, the latter was as a crossover event with&nbsp;Grey’s, but it was still something that wasn’t confined to a typical&nbsp;Grey’s&nbsp;script.&nbsp;Aside from acting, Pompeo has also earned money through endorsements.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Dempsey, well, the performer has been pulling down money for years. Dempsey has been regularly appearing in projects since the 1980s and has been paid accordingly. While&nbsp;Grey’s has been awfully kind to the performer, he has also done projects like&nbsp;Enchanted, Transformers: Dark of the Moon,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Bridget Jones’s Baby. Dempsey, much like Pompeo, has also cleaned up with his endorsements.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs You Probably Forgot Made Cameos On ‘Grey’s Anatomy’</a></span></p><h2 id=katherine-heigl-30-million>Katherine Heigl $30 Million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/161F63E4-704C-4A59-9AFC-60254BF3FA87.jpeg><p>Dempsey and Pompeo are both at the top with $80 million, and other performers find themselves quite a ways away from that number. Katherine Heigl, despite not having been on the show for years, is actually the next cast member up with a comfortable $30 million net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Heigl has not been involved in the show for years, it should be noted that she was a primary character for the first six seasons of the show. This means that she made plenty of money and continues to make some from the airings of her episodes. However, the star had her sights set on the big screen, as well.</p><p>There was once a point when Katherine Heigl was thriving on the big screen, but things would eventually taper off after she made waves with her comments against the writers of&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy. Heigl landed starring roles in huge hits like&nbsp;Knocked Up, 27 Dresses, The Ugly Truth,&nbsp;and&nbsp;New Year’s Eve. Yeah, she was rolling the dough during this time and was a star.</p><p>Things have simmered down over time, but she is still regularly working and cashing in with her projects. In fact, her newest show,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefly Lane</a>, will be debuting on the small screen this year.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Patrick Dempsey Returned To ‘Grey’s Anatomy’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sandra-oh-25-million>Sandra Oh $25 Million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/25E6A43E-0C63-4DE8-A3D3-643750AD25F6.jpeg><p>Katherine Heigl’s $30 million net worth is just a shade higher than Sandra Oh’s, who, according to&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth, is sporting a $25 million net worth. This is thanks to plenty of successful projects under her belt.</p><p>Cristina Yang, the character the Oh played on&nbsp;Grey’s for the show’s first 10 seasons, is as loved and as popular as ever, and Oh was banking in on each episode that she appeared in during that time. The fans want nothing more than for her to return, and if that ever comes to pass, then she will be compensated handsomely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since 2018, Sandra Oh has been starring in the hit series,&nbsp;Killing Eve, which has been greenlit for a fourth season. The show has allowed the performer to showcase her acting abilities and it has been awfully kind to her bank account. Oh has also appeared in hit projects like&nbsp;The Princess Diaries, Arliss,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sideways.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened To Katherine Heigl’s Acting Career After She Left ‘Grey’s Anatomy’?</a></span></p><p>The original&nbsp;Grey’s&nbsp;cast has done well financially, and they will continue to roll in the dough as long as they keep doing what they’re doing.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Season 18 Of ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ Happen?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaGTnXqwvsigoKeZnGK0s7HYrGSappGpvK7FjKyrmqpdna60edOhnGagmZy1pr%2FTZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhich-original-greys-anatomy-star-has-the-highest-net-worth.html&text=Which%20Original%20%27Grey%27s%20Anatomy%27%20Star%20Has%20The%20Highest%20Net%20Worth%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhich-original-greys-anatomy-star-has-the-highest-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhich-original-greys-anatomy-star-has-the-highest-net-worth.html&title=Which%20Original%20%27Grey%27s%20Anatomy%27%20Star%20Has%20The%20Highest%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhich-original-greys-anatomy-star-has-the-highest-net-worth.html&title=Which%20Original%20%27Grey%27s%20Anatomy%27%20Star%20Has%20The%20Highest%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhich-original-greys-anatomy-star-has-the-highest-net-worth.html&title=Which%20Original%20%27Grey%27s%20Anatomy%27%20Star%20Has%20The%20Highest%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhich-original-greys-anatomy-star-has-the-highest-net-worth.html&description=Which%20Original%20%27Grey%27s%20Anatomy%27%20Star%20Has%20The%20Highest%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-lejuan-james-wife-and-baby-mama-camila-inc-everything-to-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Lejuan James Wife And Baby Mama Camila Inc?
