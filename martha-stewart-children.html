Traditionally, magazine covers have represented the idealized notion of beauty, but over the past few years, people’s standards have become more expansive.&nbsp;</p><p>The hope is that this progress will continue, leading to more age diversity in media and portrayals of women considered beautiful or worthy of admiration.</p><p>MJ Day, the editor-in-chief of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit, expressed the magazine’s goal to challenge the industry’s arbitrary notion of beauty.&nbsp;</p><p>She described Stewart as a legend and a great female entrepreneur who built a dynasty against all odds.&nbsp;</p><p>With her appearance in a bathing suit at the age of 81, Stewart also serves as a recalibration of assumptions about women and their sexuality as they age.</p><p>Embracing this evolution is at the forefront of Stewart’s mind. Her motto, <strong>“When you’re through changing, you’re through,”</strong> reflects her willingness to adapt, grow, and challenge societal norms.&nbsp;</p><p>By boldly stepping onto the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit, Stewart has become an inspiration for women of all ages, proving that beauty, confidence, and sexuality are not limited by age.</p><p>While Martha Stewart’s children, Alexis may have had big shoes to fill, she has carved her own path as a successful television and radio personality, as well as an entrepreneur.&nbsp;</p><p>This article delves into the life and accomplishments of Alexis Stewart, highlighting her career, family, and connection with her iconic mother, Martha Stewart.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life and Education</h2><p>Martha Stewart children, Alexis Stewart was born on September 27, 1965.
