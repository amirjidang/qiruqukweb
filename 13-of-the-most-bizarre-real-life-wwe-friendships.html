It entails traveling to different cities every night, and being away from loved ones months at a time, so it can definitely take a toll on a person. To cope with this lifestyle, wrestlers form friendships and bonds with their fellow colleagues.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These friendships are oftentimes a replacement for family. The relationships they form are strong ones, and they might be at each other’s necks in the ring, but outside of it, some of these superstars couldn’t be closer. When retired wrestlers are asked what they miss most about the business, most stars answer: the car rides to shows. Just imagine having your best friend (or friends) in one car driving around the country doing what you love. Those are the cherished moments that leave a significant impact on a wrestler’s life.</p><p>With the gimmicks that some of these wrestlers have, it's hard to picture them being friends. Here is the 13 most bizarre real life WWE friendships. Enjoy!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rey-mysterio-amp-batista>13. Rey Mysterio & Batista</h2><p>The two became closer than ever&nbsp;under sad circumstances, unfortunately. <a href=#>Mysterio</a> and <a href=#>Batista</a> were very close friends of Eddie Guerrero, and when he passed away the bond between these two grew, as they both helped each other while grieving the loss of their close friend. They would later go on to team up and win the WWE Tag Team titles which they dedicated to Guerrero. Even though both moved on from WWE, they still keep a close friendship riding their motorcycles together. The two share a close bond outside of the ring working on their car and motorcycle collections.</p><p></p><h2 id=cm-punk-amp-kofi-kingston>12. CM Punk & Kofi Kingston</h2><p>These two unexpectedly became close after winning&nbsp;the WWE Tag Team titles. Their bond continued to grow following their run as tag team. Kofi explained just how close he was to <a href=#>Punk</a> in an interview, saying "Yeah, we were each other's road wives, with Punk, I consider him to be like a brother to me. He's one of the guys who took me under his wing when I first came. So we've been able to maintain a good relationship. And there are very few people in the business that you can call true friends, so I consider Punk to be that and more. So yes, "road wife" is the term we used to sum that all up.” Despite&nbsp;Punk leaving the company, the two of them still maintain close friends today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=mick-foley-amp-terry-funk>11. Mick Foley & Terry Funk</h2><p><a href=#>Foley</a> and Funk are very similar in the ring, both men&nbsp;put their bodies on the line in some of the most&nbsp;extreme spots, and they live for that adrenaline rush and massive crowd reaction. Before the infamous Hell in a Cell match at the King of the Ring, Foley discussed with&nbsp;Funk some ideas for dangerous spots to perform in the match. The idea of throwing Foley off the top of the cell came from the conversation between the two hardcore legends. The wrestlers still share a very unique bond to this day.</p><p></p><h2 id=john-cena-amp-randy-orton>10. John Cena & Randy Orton</h2><p>Two of the top stars of this generation, <a href=#>John Cena</a> and <a href=#>Randy Orton</a>, have managed to sustain quite the careers during their time with the WWE. Both&nbsp;careers have taken a similar path, they both started in Ohio Valley Wrestling&nbsp;and both rose to stardom in the WWE in 2002. However, they didn’t start out as friends; Cena noted he and Orton didn’t get along because Orton was very difficult to be around during their time at OVW, and this was largely due to the fact that Orton had an inflated ego with the other talent. Once Orton matured during his time with the WWE, he and John Cena became close friends. In a documentary that was done on Orton, Cena talks about how Orton has grown as a person and how they became very close friends over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=the-undertaker-amp-kane>9. The Undertaker & Kane</h2><p>They are known as the Brothers of Destruction in the ring, and they are like brothers outside of it. <a href=#>Taker</a> and <a href=#>Kane</a> are very close friends. They have feuded and partnered over the years and it created a very close bond between them. Taker considers Kane such a close friend that he even offered him to end his WrestleMania streak, according to rumors. Considering how close Taker is to him, he refused to do the job.</p><p></p><h2 id=daniel-bryan-amp-ryback>8. Daniel Bryan & Ryback</h2><p>As seen on the WWE network show Table for 3, <a href=#>Daniel Bryan</a> and Ryback are quite close&nbsp;outside of the ring. The two wrestlers were travelling partners&nbsp;until Bryan’s pranks were too much for Ryback to handle. Ryback has openly stated that he does not trust anyone in the business. As suggested by <a href=#>Stone Cold Steve Austin</a>, Ryback has kept his eyes open for the sharks that have been swimming amongst the dolphins in the ocean of WWE. But Bryan is one of the few he considers a good friend and admittedly respects Bryan over any other wrestler that he's ever met.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=trish-stratus-amp-lita>7. Trish Stratus & Lita</h2><p>When women’s wrestling was at its best, these two were the top of the Women's Division. Their feud is arguably one of the best in women’s wrestling history. What made their chemistry so unique was the fact that they were the best of friends outside of the ring. Following both their retirements, the former Divas grew even closer. Their bond reached new heights when&nbsp;<a href=#>Trish</a> chose Lita as the godmother&nbsp;of her son.&nbsp;The two maintain a very close friendship today, and they still reunite&nbsp;rather frequently.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-cm-punk-amp-joey-mercury>6.&nbsp;CM Punk & Joey Mercury</h2><p>The story between these two friends is quite extraordinary. Joey Mercury hit rockbottom after the WWE released him because of a drug problem. Things spiraled worse for Mercury when he was no longer able to make payments for his house. After talking to CM Punk about his current status, Punk bought Mercury's house for him. He also helped Joey get back on his feet and join a rehab facility. Ultimately, Mercury credits Punk for saving his life. Joey claims Punk will forever be his best friend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=stone-cold-amp-jim-ross>5. Stone Cold & Jim Ross</h2><p>In 2002, when <a href=#>Austin</a> unexpectedly left the company and “took his ball and went home”, many thought the relationship between him and <a href=#>Vince</a> was irreparable. Jim’s simple gesture of sending a letter to Austin, saying if he ever needed to talk he was there for him, led Austin back to the WWE and repaired the damage between Austin and Vince. Steve&nbsp;has stated, “Jim is a very close personal friend and was very instrumental and a big part of my career and I love the guy”. Powerful words coming from the Texas rattlesnake.</p><p></p><h2 id=triple-h-amp-ric-flair>4. Triple H & Ric Flair</h2><p>These two are separated by twenty years in age, but their bond is one of the closest in wrestling. In 2003, <a href=#>Flair</a> was going through a hard time in his life, he was getting a divorce and WWE wasn't using him in any capacity. <a href=#>Hunter</a> said he looked like a shell of his former self. Hunter later came up with the idea of the stable "evolution" and decided to make Flair a part of it. This changed Flair’s life, as he fell in love with wrestling again and got his mind off of his personal troubles. Flair has stated that Hunter is a very sensitive guy in an insensitive business. These two are so close that it was Hunter who came out during Flair’s retirement speech to introduce surprise appearances of Flair’s family and closest friends to the ring. During the Steve Austin Podcast, Flair referred to Hunter as his best friend. The two still speak on a weekly basis despite Hunter's busy schedule.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=vince-mcmahon-amp-the-undertaker>3. Vince McMahon & The Undertaker</h2><p>This friendship is based on loyalty for one another. Vince has a soft spot for <a href=#>The Undertaker</a>, when Vince was asked who his favorite wrestler was, without any hesitation, McMahon replied The Undertaker. Vince feels indebted to Taker for all his contributions in and out of the ring (he was also a locker room leader behind the scenes). Taker has the most respect for Vince, and that’s the reason why he never jumped ship and left to WCW during the Monday Night Wars when the WWE was free falling. It’s nice to see even after 25 years, this bond is stronger than ever.</p><p></p><h2 id=brock-lesnar-amp-kurt-angle>2. Brock Lesnar & Kurt Angle</h2><p>It seems like <a href=#>Brock Lesnar</a> has no friends in the business. Lesnar is very private, and he doesn’t really socialize with most of his fellow peers. Brock&nbsp;once stated on Stone Cold’s Podcast, “I clock in and I clock out”. However, Lesnar does have one close friend in the industry, and that is former WWE star <a href=#>Kurt Angle</a>. The two wrestlers formed a close bond in&nbsp;2003 when they were&nbsp;involved in a program together for&nbsp;the WWE Championship. Angle mentioned in an interview that he views Brock and <a href=#>Big Show</a>&nbsp;as his best friends in wrestling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=john-cena-amp-michael-cole>1. John Cena & Michael Cole</h2><p>This is a friendship that surprises many. However, <a href=#>John Cena</a> and <a href=#>Michael Cole</a> are very close outside of the ring. They used to be travel buddies in the past. Cole gave an in depth look of their friendship in an interview on the&nbsp;Busted Open Satellite Radio Show. Cole said, “John is the most wonderful human being on the planet. He’s one of these guys, I’ll preface this by saying he’s one of my closest friends in the business”. John is also a fan of Michael's choosing to tour the world with Cole, as opposed to any other superstar in the business. Quite the unique friendship between these two individuals.</p><p>Sources: <a href=#>bleacherreport.com</a>, <a href=#>thesportster.com</a>, <a href=#>givemesport.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0e5BsZKieXam1pnnMqKqtZZKex6K%2B0Z5kq52RoXqttcWeZLCvlWKzs7XEp5usoJmlwHA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f13-of-the-most-bizarre-real-life-wwe-friendships.html&text=13%20Of%20The%20Most%20Bizarre%20Real%20Life%20WWE%20Friendships&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f13-of-the-most-bizarre-real-life-wwe-friendships.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f13-of-the-most-bizarre-real-life-wwe-friendships.html&title=13%20Of%20The%20Most%20Bizarre%20Real%20Life%20WWE%20Friendships" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f13-of-the-most-bizarre-real-life-wwe-friendships.html&title=13%20Of%20The%20Most%20Bizarre%20Real%20Life%20WWE%20Friendships" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f13-of-the-most-bizarre-real-life-wwe-friendships.html&title=13%20Of%20The%20Most%20Bizarre%20Real%20Life%20WWE%20Friendships" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f13-of-the-most-bizarre-real-life-wwe-friendships.html&description=13%20Of%20The%20Most%20Bizarre%20Real%20Life%20WWE%20Friendships" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-male-celebs-who-all-muscle-and-no-brains.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Male Celebs Who Are All Muscle And No Brains">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./13-expensive-useless-things-celebrities-buy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="13 Expensive Useless Things Celebrities Buy">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
