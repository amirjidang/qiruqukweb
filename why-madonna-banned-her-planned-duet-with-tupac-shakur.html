Her provocative image in the early eighties caused parents to wonder if she was an appropriate role model for their children. Her music videos would shock viewers with their boundary-pushing imagery. In 1990, her "Justify My Love" video was even banned by MTV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, when Madonna released her "Sex" book in 1992, <a href=#>the controversy ignited a backlash with many questioning the future of her career</a>. In order to bounce back from this scandal, Madonna would need to avoid controversy with her next project.</p><p>It was around this time that Madonna was dating Tupac Shakur. The two even wrote and recorded a duet for Madonna's next album. However, when the song was released, Madonna replaced his verse with someone else.</p><h2 id=madonna-wanted-to-soften-her-image-following-the-39-sex-39-book-backlash>Madonna Wanted To Soften Her Image Following The 'Sex' Book Backlash</h2><p>In October 1992, Madonna released her "Sex" book. The book was a collection of photographs by fashion photographer Steven Meisel. The shots depicted Madonna as well as a bunch of other models nude. It even featured cameos from Vanilla Ice, Naomi Campbell, and Big Daddy Kane.</p><p>The book caused controversy yet again for Madonna. However, the reaction sparked a backlash that had many wondering if Madonna's career would survive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think people’s reaction to specific situations in the book was much more a reflection of that person than me," Madonna told 60 Minutes Australia at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar29732950.jpg><p>Thirty years later, <a href=#>Madonna reflected on the book's legacy</a> in an Instagram post.</p><p>"30 years ago I published a book called S.E.X. In addition to photos of me naked there were photos of Men kissing Men, Woman kissing Woman and Me kissing everyone. I also wrote about my sexual fantasies and shared my point of view about sexuality in an ironic way," she wrote.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Meeting Madonna For The First Time Was A Nightmare For Kim Petras</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I spent the next few years being interviewed by narrow minded people who tried to shame me for empowering myself as a Woman," Madonna continued. "I was called a whore, a witch, a heretic and the devil."</p><h2 id=tupac-broke-up-with-madonna-and-later-wrote-her-a-heartfelt-letter-from-prison>Tupac Broke Up With Madonna And Later Wrote Her A Heartfelt Letter From Prison</h2><p>Madonna made an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman following the "Sex" book scandal in March 1994. During the interview, Madonna used the f-bomb 13 times and confronted Letterman for making fun of her in the past.</p><p>Years later, <a href=#>Madonna would reflect on her motivation for this moment</a> when speaking to Howard Stern in 2015.</p><p>"I was dating Tupac Shakur at the time, and the thing is he got me all riled up on life in general," Madonna said. "So, when I went on the show, I was feeling very gangsta."</p><p>The revelation made headlines everywhere. There were rumors the two dated back in 1994, but this was the first time Madonna herself confirmed it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar29756462.jpg><p>Many have wondered if the two simply had a fling or if there was more to the relationship. In 2017, TMZ obtained a three-page letter Shakur wrote to Madonna from prison.</p><p>"First and foremost, I must apologize to you because, like you said, I haven’t been the kind of friend I know I am capable of being," he wrote.</p><p>"An interview where you said <a href=#>‘I’m off to rehabilitate all the rappers & basketball players’</a> or something to that effect those words cut me deep seeing how I had never known you to be with any rappers besides myself. It was at this moment out of hurt & and natural instinct to strike back and defend my heart & ego that I said a lot of things."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Michael Jackson Refused To Work With Tupac Because Of One Specific Person In The Music Industry</a></span></p><p>Shakur also admitted he was "intimidated" by Madonna's sexually charged persona.</p><p>"Please understand my previous position as that of a young man with limited experience with [an] extremely famous sex symbol."</p><p>Shakur even revealed their racial differences played a part in his decision to end things.</p><p>"For you to be seen with a Black man wouldn't in any way jeopardize your career, if anything it would make you seem that much more open and exciting," he wrote. "But for me at least in my previous perception I felt due to my 'image' I would be letting down half of the people who made me what I thought I was."</p><p>Shakur ended his letter by asking Madonna to come visit him, so the two could speak "face to face."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I don’t know how you feel about visiting me but if you could find it in your heart, I would love to speak face to face with you," Shakur wrote.

The project saw her working with producers like Babyface, Dave Hall, Nellee Hooper, and Dallas Austin. The album went in an R&B direction, with Madonna creating a different sound compared to her previous release, "Erotica."</p><p>The album contained "Take a Bow," which went to number one, and "Human Nature." The latter was an unapologetic defense of her previous era. Madonna defiantly sang on the track, "I'm not sorry, it's human nature."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, Madonna was aware that if she wanted to move forward with her career, she would need to avoid controversy with this album.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Elton John Ran Into Madonna After Bad-Mouthing Her In The Press And He Had Quite The Reaction Nobody Expected</a></span></p><p>Madonna collaborated with Shakur on the song "I'd Rather Be Your Lover," which was included on the album. However, the version on the album replaces Shakur's verse with a verse by Me'Shell NdegéOcello. It is widely believed that Madonna replaced Shakur <a href=#>to dissociate from any possible controversy after his sexual assault case came to light</a>. The demo later leaked online.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdoq6lu82nmGaakaO7prCMoZyrZaChrq%2B6xJ1kna2VqXq4tdOhZK2toJawbr%2FHmqKuql8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-madonna-banned-her-planned-duet-with-tupac-shakur.html&text=The%20Real%20Reason%20Madonna%20Banned%20Her%20Planned%20Duet%20With%20Tupac%20Shakur&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-madonna-banned-her-planned-duet-with-tupac-shakur.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-madonna-banned-her-planned-duet-with-tupac-shakur.html&title=The%20Real%20Reason%20Madonna%20Banned%20Her%20Planned%20Duet%20With%20Tupac%20Shakur" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-madonna-banned-her-planned-duet-with-tupac-shakur.html&title=The%20Real%20Reason%20Madonna%20Banned%20Her%20Planned%20Duet%20With%20Tupac%20Shakur" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-madonna-banned-her-planned-duet-with-tupac-shakur.html&title=The%20Real%20Reason%20Madonna%20Banned%20Her%20Planned%20Duet%20With%20Tupac%20Shakur" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-madonna-banned-her-planned-duet-with-tupac-shakur.html&description=The%20Real%20Reason%20Madonna%20Banned%20Her%20Planned%20Duet%20With%20Tupac%20Shakur" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-justin-biebers-step-siblings-think-about-his-fame-music-reputation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Surprising Truth About What Justin Biebers Siblings Really Think About His Fame And Complicat">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./friends-cast-hidden-messages-in-best-episodes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Friends Cast And Crew Inserted Hidden Messages Into The Show's Best Episodes">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
