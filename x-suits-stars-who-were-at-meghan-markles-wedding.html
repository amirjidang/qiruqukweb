Before the Duchess of Sussex garnered significant media and public attention due to her marriage to <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and entry into the Royal world, she was an actress. She<a href=#> played Rachel Zane in Suits for 7 seasons, a role she didn't think she would get</a>, but it turned out to be her most noteworthy and last screen role. In a grand wedding that changed her life, were all her Suits co-stars present to witness the televised spectacle of a royal wedding that would be remembered for years to come?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=meghan-markle-39-s-career-and-playing-rachel-zane><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Meghan Markle's Career And Playing Rachel Zane</span></h2><p>Prior to landing the role of Rachel Zane in Suits, Meghan's acting career was not a walk in the park. She had troubles getting roles, so she had to explore other careers alongside acting. She had minimal screen time on TV, appearing on shows like Century City, CSI: NY, Fringe, and films like Remember Me, The Candidate, and Horrible Bosses. In 2011, she got her big break on Suits appearing for 7 seasons as a paralegal and later on, an attorney.</p><h2 id=meghan-markle-39-s-wedding-to-prince-harry><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Meghan Markle's Wedding To Prince Harry</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meghan started dating Prince Harry, son of Princess Diana and grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, in July 2016 and whole world began to follow her life. When Meghan's engagement to Prince Harry was announced on November 27, 2017, and that she would be quitting acting, Meghan began a fairytale journey which was met with several reactions. As expected, the wedding was nothing short of magical. The two wed in May 2018 at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. Now, after 2 kids, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor and Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor, the couple remains in the public eye even after stepping away from royal engagements.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Did Prince Harry And Meghan Markle Actually Meet?</a></span></p><h2 id=gina-torres-stunned-in-a-floral-appearance><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Gina Torres Stunned In A Floral Appearance</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to the oyal wedding, stars of Suits hosted a pre-nuptials dinner, which had in attendance Gina Torres, who also attended the wedding, wearing a red and white floral dress and cream hat.
