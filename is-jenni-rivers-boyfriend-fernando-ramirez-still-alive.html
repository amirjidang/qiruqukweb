One ex-husband, Jose Trinidad Marin, was convicted of assault not only on Jenni's younger sister, but also two of Jenni's daughters (including one of his own).</p><p>Jenni also accused one of her exes (Esteban Loaiza, whom she was married to yet separated from at the time of her passing) of having a relationship with her daughter Chiquis.</p><p>While those accusations seem to have bled over into Jenni's legacy, and <a href=#>her family seemingly argues over the late singer's estate</a>, there's one bright spot for fans who miss the singer: her boyfriend Fernando Ramirez.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on April 9, 2022: </strong>By all accounts, Fernando Ramirez remains alive and well to this day. However, it seems like he mostly stays out of the public eye, and so not too much is known about what he's up to these days. Jenni Rivera's first husband is serving a long prison sentence, her second husband died in prison in 2009, and her third husband was recently released from prison and subsequently deported to Mexico.</p><h2 id=who-was-jenni-39-s-boyfriend-when-she-died>Who Was Jenni's Boyfriend When She Died?</h2><p>Though <a href=#>Jenni remained married to Esteban Loaiza</a> at the time of her passing, the two had separated months earlier. They had formally filed for divorce, as well, but it turned out there wasn't time for court proceedings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the depth of Jenni's Wikipedia entries, though, not much is known about who she was dating when she died.</p><p>Of course, Jenni's dedicated fans, friends, and family knew who she was involved with and apparently wholeheartedly approved. As it turns out, Jenni and Fernando Ramirez had a long history of off-and-on dating that spanned multiple marriages of Jenni's.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-jenni-rivera-and-fernando-ramirez>What Happened To Jenni Rivera And Fernando Ramirez?</h2><p>Looking back at Jenni Rivera's troubled marriages, it's bittersweet that she left behind the one person that fans consider her true love.</p><p>Jenni was first married in 1984 to Jose Trinidad Marin, whom she divorced in 1992. Then she was married to Juan Lopez from 1997 to 2003. Finally, she married Esteban Loaiza in 2010 but was estranged from him as of 2012 when she passed away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And yet, Fernando Ramirez -- AKA Fernie -- claims that Jenni was his soul mate. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The two dated off and on</a> for more than a decade, sources confirm, though Ramirez notes they were definitely not together at any point while Jenni was married (or at least, married and not officially separated).</p><p>Other sources suggest that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fernie and Jenni only dated between 2002 and 2007</a>, but the timelines are apparently up for debate at this point. Of course, that's not the only report that's up for interpretation these days.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Jenni Rivera's Tumultuous Relationship With Juan Lopez, And How She Moved On">Jenni Rivera's Tumultuous Relationship With Juan Lopez, And How She Moved On</a></span></p><h2 id=is-fernie-ramirez-still-alive>Is Fernie Ramirez Still Alive?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ramirez, who also goes by the name El Pelon, has apparently been the subject of false death reports in recent years. The fact is, it's difficult to track down information about Fernie, especially as the last interview he seems to have given was in 2019.</p><p>At that time, though, he was very much still in love with Jenni, calling her "everything." Further, Fernando explained, "She was my soul mate. She was my best friend. That's what it was and I miss her a lot."</p><p>Further, El Pelon elaborated that his time with Jenni was very special for a variety of reasons. The two met a long time ago, when he was 23 (Jenni was 10 years his senior). Of his late girlfriend, Ramirez admitted, "It was my first serious relationship. It was about patience. It was tough at times ... being with someone so well-known."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After making that statement, of course, Fernie seems to have fallen off fans' radar again. A social media account attributed to him hasn't been updated since it announced his new music, "When I Dream About You," in August of 2020.</p><p>Rumors still persist that Fernie has died, but there's been no confirmation from his family, and fans tend to argue over the subject on what exists of his social media presence.</p><h2 id=who-is-fernie-ramirez>Who Is Fernie Ramirez?</h2><p>Fernie's 2019 interview with Billboard seems to have been one of his last public chats with a journalist. Despite the rumors that he died, it seems that Fernando Ramirez is still alive, he's just focused on his career and keeping an otherwise low profile.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In that interview, Fernando explained that Jenni had been his inspiration for a musical career, though he'd begun singing ages ago while locked up in juvie (good acoustics opened his eyes to the possibility of a music career, he explained).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Whatever Happened To Jenni Rivera's Last Husband, Esteban Loaiza?">Whatever Happened To Jenni Rivera's Last Husband, Esteban Loaiza?</a></span></p><p>Noting that he learned a lot about the business from Jenni, Fernie also began working with Rivera's former manager (Pete Salgado). But everything else, he did alone, even as Jenni's star grew brighter, and their relationship remained mostly in the shadows.</p><p>At the time of that 2019 interview, Ramirez said his music would have a "Chicano twist," borrowing from and indulging in banda the same way Jenni did. While some <a href=#>fans wonder if Jenni may still be alive</a>, it seems clearer that yes, Fernie is, and he's focusing on his music and future rather than dwelling on the past.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>What Is Late Singer Jenni Rivera's Son Michael Marin Rivera Doing Now?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWamruvtYyroK%2Bdoqh6o7vYn6minZ6Zeqex0aeYp5yfYr%2BiucirnLNlo6m2rbiMmqOirpVk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-jenni-rivers-boyfriend-fernando-ramirez-still-alive.html&text=Is%20Jenni%20Rivera%27s%20Boyfriend%20Fernando%20Ramirez%20Still%20Alive%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-jenni-rivers-boyfriend-fernando-ramirez-still-alive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-jenni-rivers-boyfriend-fernando-ramirez-still-alive.html&title=Is%20Jenni%20Rivera%27s%20Boyfriend%20Fernando%20Ramirez%20Still%20Alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-jenni-rivers-boyfriend-fernando-ramirez-still-alive.html&title=Is%20Jenni%20Rivera%27s%20Boyfriend%20Fernando%20Ramirez%20Still%20Alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-jenni-rivers-boyfriend-fernando-ramirez-still-alive.html&title=Is%20Jenni%20Rivera%27s%20Boyfriend%20Fernando%20Ramirez%20Still%20Alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-jenni-rivers-boyfriend-fernando-ramirez-still-alive.html&description=Is%20Jenni%20Rivera%27s%20Boyfriend%20Fernando%20Ramirez%20Still%20Alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-meg-ryan-gay-whats-the-top-gun-actresss-sexuality-561498-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Meg Ryan Gay?
