The actress who was 21 years old at the time was later admitted to the hospital during the shooting of Georgia Rule.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She was overheated and dehydrated," Lohan's publicist said at the time. But, eventually, the truth came out that Lohan was just unable to make it to set as a result of staying out too late and partying.</p><p>James G. Robinson, who is a studio executive, made a public statement about Lohan.</p><p>The statement read that Lohan was "irresponsible and unprofessional." He also mentioned several other things like, "various late arrivals and absences from the set," and, "we are well aware that your ongoing all-night heavy partying is the real reason for your so-called 'exhaustion'."</p><p>Lohan's fame dropped rather drastically at that time and she was labeled as an insurance liability. It must have been so difficult for her and yet, she didn't want to give up so soon.</p><p>Lohan was given small projects and had been cast in the TV series Ugly Betty (2006) as a minor role. Additionally, she hosted a documentary about human trafficking in India for BBC.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But just as everyone has their good sides and bad, people apparently have focused on Lohan's bad side more often.</p><p>Being a woman of wealth at such an early age, she pampered herself by buying expensive cars, handbags, and designer clothes, and enjoyed meals at extravagant restaurants. Lohan even sometimes partied at three clubs in one single night.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lohan was also allegedly found using illicit drugs. In 2010, according to a Business Insider article, Hollyscoop<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported on how much Lohan had spent on narcotics.</a></p><p>"There were reports a few days ago that Lohan was allegedly spending about $5,000 a week on drugs, but our 'source' insists that this figure is reportedly closer to about $3,500," the article stated. "The last few months Lohan was allegedly 'spotted' narcotics because she's in debt to the people who are supplying her, but no one's really giving her a hard time because she's Lindsay Lohan. The source added that Lohan is apparently in $30,000 debt for narcotics."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The story doesn't end there. Between 2007 and 2013, Lohan was arrested a few too many times for DUIs, altercations, shoplifting, and reckless driving.</p><p>In 2010, she was sentenced to 90 days in jail for not attending her court-ordered weekly education classes. Just as her appearances in court racked up, mugshots and rehab stints began to put her bank account into jeopardy.</p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan-has-to-repay-her-debts>Lindsay Lohan Has To Repay Her Debts</h2><h3 id=lohan-39-s-bank-account-was-seized-by-the-irs-to-repay-debts>Lohan's bank account was seized by the IRS to repay debts</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar50555875-1.jpg><p>Lohan had managed to rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt over the years.
