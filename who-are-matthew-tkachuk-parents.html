One of Matthew Tkachuk parents had also made a name in the field of the NHL.</p><p>Before peeking into his parents’ life, let’s first have a brief look at Matthew’s achievements linked with National Hockey League.</p><p>From a young age, his passion for ice hockey glowed brightly. Through hard work and dedication, he slowly climbed the ranks to become one of the most sought-after players in the game.</p><p>Matthew Tkachuk is a skilled winger in professional ice hockey and holds the alternate captain position for the Florida Panthers in the NHL.</p><p>He was honored to participate in the Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament in 2010. It was undoubtedly an unforgettable experience for him to play alongside Logan Brown, Clayton Keller, and Luke Kunin in the minor ice hockey team of St. Louis Blues.</p><p>In May 2015, he forfeited his NCAA eligibility after signing with the London Knights of the OHL. The team had selected him in the fourth round of the 2013 Ontario Hockey League Priority Selection.</p><p>Recently, Matthew made it into the <a href=#>news</a> again after saving his team from a defeat at the last moment of the game.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Matthew Tkachuk sent Florida Panthers to Stanley Cup Final in a heroic way</h2><p>After a lengthy 27-year wait, the Florida Panthers, who were once considered a hockey joke, has finally earned the opportunity to compete for the sport’s most fantastic prize.</p><p>In a thrilling 4-3 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes, Tkachuk scored his second goal of the game with a mere 4.9 seconds remaining, propelling the Panthers into the Stanley Cup final for the first time since 1996.</p><p>Now the Panthers will face either Vegas or Dallas for the Stanley Cup in the upcoming week. Currently, Vegas holds a commanding 3-0 lead in the Western Conference title series.</p><p>There’s no doubt that Matthew Tkachuk parents are all the reasons behind his successful career, as they started to support him at an early age with ice hockey passion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When did Matthew Tkachuk parents first meet?</h2><p>Matthew Tkachuk parents, Keith Tkachuk and Chantal Oster, have been married since February 28, 1997, after their first meeting in Winnipeg.</p><p>Together they raised three children named Matthew, Brady, and Taryn. His father remains a prominent figure in St. Louis as he is involved as an investor in the sports talk radio station KFNS 590 AM, located in St. Louis, MO, however, not much is known about her mother.&nbsp;</p><p>He currently serves as an assistant coach for the St. Louis Blues Pee-wee AAA hockey team.</p><p>Matthew Tkachuk parents’ ethnic background is mixed as his father’s mother’s side is linked with Irish ancestry and is actually related to Tom Fitzgerald, the general manager of the New Jersey Devils.</p><p>However, Keith shared that he is unsure about his Ukrainian surname’s origin, suggesting it could be Polish, Russian, or Ukrainian.</p><p>Matthew Tkachuk father is also cousins with Jimmy and Kevin Hayes. Kevin Hayes played in the NHL but sadly passed away on August 23, 2021, while Jimmy Hayes is currently a player for the Philadelphia Flyers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where was Matthew Tkachuk born?</h2><p>Tkachuk was born and raised in Scottsdale, Arizona, and his father, Keith, played for the Phoenix Coyotes when he was born.</p><p>After his father’s trade to the Blues in 2001, the whole family relocated to Chesterfield, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many Tkachuk brothers are there?</h2><p>There are two brothers in the Tkachuk family, Matthew and Brady.</p><p>Brady is 23 years old, while Matthew Tkachuk age is 25 and he is the older sibling, with a two-year age gap between them.</p><p>Matthew Tkachuk sister, Taryn, is also a talented athlete. She is currently enrolled at the University of Virginia, where she actively participates in the field hockey team.</p><p>During her time in high school at Villa Duchesne and Oak Hill School, she established herself as a standout player, leading all high school athletes in Missouri in both total points and goals throughout her four years.</p><p>Taryn also held the excellence of being the state leader in assists on two occasions. Her remarkable high school career concluded with an impressive tally of 135 goals and 361 points.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, none of the Tkachuk family members have Canadian heritage. Keith, their father, was born in Boston and attended Malden Catholic High School before spending a season at Boston University.</p><p>Brady and Matthew were born in Scottsdale, Arizona, while their father played for the Coyotes. Most of their childhood was spent in the St. Louis region, where they actively participated in the St. Louis AAA Blues youth hockey program.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Matthew Tkachuk salary?</h2><p>On July 22, 2022, Tkachuk was traded from the Flames to the Panthers. Immediately after the trade, he inked an eight-year contract extension with Florida worth $76 million. This new agreement carries an average annual value of $9.5 million.</p><p>Tkachuk was a restricted free agent during the offseason after completing a three-year bridge deal with the Flames valued at $21 million. The initial contract was signed on September 25, 2019.</p><p>The Flames filed for salary arbitration with Tkachuk on July 18, 2022, which prevented other teams from making offer sheets. However, just two days later, Tkachuk informed the Flames that he had no intention of signing a long-term contract with the team.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much is Matthew Tkachuk worth?</h2><p>As of 2022, Matthew Tkachuk net worth is estimated to be around $60 million. He signed a three-year contract with the Calgary Flames valued at $21 million, receiving an annual salary of $7 million and a signing bonus of $7.5 million.</p><p>In the 2021-22 season, Tkachuk earned a base salary of $9 million while having a cap hit of $7 million.</p><p>Throughout his six seasons with the Calgary Flames from 2016 to 2021, he accumulated a total earning of $15.9975 million, including a signing bonus of $7.7775 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-7-1024x326.png> <span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDDx6hkmqqVYrqiwNOhnLBlpKCupLTUpGSpmaKau7W%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-matthew-tkachuk-parents.html&text=Who%20Are%20Matthew%20Tkachuk%20Parents%20%26amp%3b%20Where%20Is%20The%20Tkachuk%20Family%20From%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-matthew-tkachuk-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-matthew-tkachuk-parents.html&title=Who%20Are%20Matthew%20Tkachuk%20Parents%20%26amp%3b%20Where%20Is%20The%20Tkachuk%20Family%20From%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-are-matthew-tkachuk-parents.html&title=Who%20Are%20Matthew%20Tkachuk%20Parents%20%26amp%3b%20Where%20Is%20The%20Tkachuk%20Family%20From%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-matthew-tkachuk-parents.html&title=Who%20Are%20Matthew%20Tkachuk%20Parents%20%26amp%3b%20Where%20Is%20The%20Tkachuk%20Family%20From%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-matthew-tkachuk-parents.html&description=Who%20Are%20Matthew%20Tkachuk%20Parents%20%26amp%3b%20Where%20Is%20The%20Tkachuk%20Family%20From%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-bigg-jahs-wife-taunya-pickett-heres-the-truth-we-know-about-the-youtuber-456464-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Bigg Jahs Wife, Taunya Pickett?
