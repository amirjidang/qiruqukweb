A massive success, the show would also remain on the air for 11 seasons and many people consider Frasier to be <a href=#>among the best sitcoms in television history</a>.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Cast Of Frasier Ranked By Net Worth</a></span>During all 11 seasons of Frasier, series stars Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce played close-knit brothers. While it was always amusing to see Grammer and Pierce’s characters argue onscreen, most Frasier fans assumed that the actors got along in real life. All these years later, however, <a href=#>some people think that Pierce has retired from acting</a> and wonder if he and Grammer actually got along at all behind the scenes.<strong>Updated on January 16, 2023: </strong>The Frasier reboot is officially set in motion. Paramount+ picked up this sequel series, and it is set to stream on the service in the next year or so. Kelsey Grammer has been working with the streaming site over the last few years and will be reprising his starring role, though majority of the cast will comprise new actors. It is rumored, however, that his previous co-stars David Hyde Pierce, Jane Leeves, and Peri Gilpin <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">will be making cameo appearances</a> in the first season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-david-hyde-pierce-and-kelsey-grammer-see-eye-to-eye>Did David Hyde Pierce And Kelsey Grammer See Eye To Eye?</h2><p>In this day and age, it can often seem like the world is more divided along political lines than at any other time in the past. While that certainly isn’t the case, things definitely can be very tense these days. After all, there are a lot of people on both sides of the aisle who feel that the other side is out to destroy their way of life.</p><p>Given how passionately a lot of people resent those who are on the opposite side of the political aisle, some have come to believe that Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce resent each other. After all, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grammer has been vocal about supporting Donald Trump’s political career</a> and it is clear that Pierce is against the former President. In fact, when Pierce talked about Trump’s treatment of the transgender community during a 2017 appearance on The View, he made the former President seem diabolical.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Donald Trump Isn't The Only Reality TV Star That Went Into Politics</a></span></p><p>“I feel like maybe the idea is that if the country becomes sufficiently, um, heartless and selfish, then Mexico and the rest of the world will line up to pay for the wall just to keep all the Americans in.” Given that Pierce clearly had a lot of disdain for Trump during that appearance on The View, some people assume that he can’t get along with an outspoken supporter of the former President.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To David Hyde Pierce After Frasier?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to their political differences, some people think David Hyde Pierce resented the fact that Kelsey Grammer’s addiction issues made Frasier’s production more difficult. After all, on at least one occasion, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an episode of Frasier had to be reworked at the last moment when Grammer checked into rehab</a>.</p><p>As a result of Grammer’s absence, the episode "Head Games" was rewritten to have Pierce’s character take over hosting Frasier’s radio show. Given that Pierce had to learn an entire episode’s worth of dialogue at the last second, some observers assumed he was angered by it.</p><h2 id=facts-that-david-hyde-pierce-and-kelsey-grammer-actually-care-about-each-other>Facts That David Hyde Pierce And Kelsey Grammer Actually Care About Each Other</h2><p>When looking back at the history of Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce’s relationship, there is one piece of evidence that points to how much the two actors care about each other. In 2004, Grammer’s Frasier co-stars realized that his addiction issues had gotten out of control. Instead of simply complaining to producers or the press, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grammer’s co-stars quietly staged an intervention for the actor</a> that would only be revealed to the public years later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since people don’t normally hold interventions for people they don’t care about, that act says a lot. As for Grammer, he took Pierce and his other co-stars’ intervention to heart and checked into rehab. With that in mind, Pierce had to be okay with the aforementioned Frasier episode reworked late in the game since he was one of the people who pushed Grammer to get help.</p><p>When Kelsey Grammer was honored at the 41st Young Artist Academy Awards in 2021, David Hyde Pierce appeared remotely to present his longtime co-star with the Icon Award. After making jokes at his longtime co-star’s expense, Pierce called Grammer his “friend” and praised Kelsey for carrying himself with respect for his craft and empathy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Partway through his speech, David Hyde Pierce said that Kelsey Grammer has “two of the greatest gifts any artist can possess. One, respect. Respect for the work, respect for the character, and respect for his colleagues. And two, empathy. You can see Kels’s empathy in the humanity he brings to the characters he plays. Of course, he is a wonderful comedian, and he plumbed the wacky depths that make a character like Frasier so unique and eccentric. But he also recognizes what we have in common. The needs, the hopes, the fears that we all share. Our common humanity and he brings that humanity to every role he plays. That allows us, even as we laugh, to recognize ourselves and I think that is the reason why audiences and colleagues respond so heartedly to Kelsey’s work.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Assuming that David Hyde Pierce’s remarks about Kelsey Grammer in the speech were sincere, he made it very clear that he has real affection for his longtime co-star. For his part, when Grammer appeared with Pierce on the 2010 Tony Awards stage, he briefly got choked up while revealing that David had been awarded a humanitarian award.</p><p>At the end of the day, it seems clear that Grammer and Pierce may not have the easiest relationship at times, but there are real feelings of love between them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6ZmXqpxcOeZKmhlaewpnnKnqOsnalitLOtzKacq2WWp7amusOsn6KoXZu%2For%2FInqlo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdavid-hyde-pierce-kelsey-grammer-friendship-frasier.html&text=David%20Hyde%20Pierce%20and%20Kelsey%20Grammers%20Complicated%20Relationship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-hyde-pierce-kelsey-grammer-friendship-frasier.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-hyde-pierce-kelsey-grammer-friendship-frasier.html&title=David%20Hyde%20Pierce%20and%20Kelsey%20Grammers%20Complicated%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdavid-hyde-pierce-kelsey-grammer-friendship-frasier.html&title=David%20Hyde%20Pierce%20and%20Kelsey%20Grammers%20Complicated%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-hyde-pierce-kelsey-grammer-friendship-frasier.html&title=David%20Hyde%20Pierce%20and%20Kelsey%20Grammers%20Complicated%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-hyde-pierce-kelsey-grammer-friendship-frasier.html&description=David%20Hyde%20Pierce%20and%20Kelsey%20Grammers%20Complicated%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./are-demi-moore-and-bruce-willis-actually-friends.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Bruce Willis And Demi Moore Actually Stay On Good Terms Post-Divorce?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./david-arquette-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David Arquette Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
