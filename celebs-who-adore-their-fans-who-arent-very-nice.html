Plenty of celebs don't have the patience to deal with adoring fans-- even though fan bases are usually the reason why celebs are as wealthy and successful as they are.</p><h2 id=loves-her-fans-ariana-grande><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Loves Her Fans: Ariana Grande</span></h2><p class=p1>Ariana Grande is an example of a celebrity who absolutely loves her fans. She appreciates the love that her fans give her all the time and she proved that when she decided to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">provide a group of her fans with free hot chocolate</a> and cookies while they waited for her Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show performance. She definitely did not have to do that but she went above and beyond.</p><h2 id=doesn-t-care-for-his-fans-christian-bale><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Doesn’t Care For His Fans: Christian Bale</span></h2><p class=p1>Christian Bale has a bad reputation for the way he acts with his fans. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He has reportedly made fans cry</a>&nbsp;from his brash and harsh responses. He does not care to take pictures with fans and would rather not be bothered by them at all. It seems like several fans of his who approached him for pictures walked away with bad tastes in their mouths from their interactions with him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=loves-his-fans-zac-efron><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Loves His Fans: Zac Efron</span></h2><p class=p1><a href=#>Zac Efron</a> totally loves his fans! He has a massive amount of respect and love for them. On the set of Baywatch, a fan excitedly tried to take a selfie with Zac Efron but he accidentally dropped his iPhone. The screen shattered! Zac Efron still posed for a picture with the fan and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">then bought the fan a brand new iPhone</a>! It was super considerate of him. Another example of a celeb going above and beyond.</p><h2 id=doesn-t-care-for-her-fans-kate-winslet><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Doesn’t Care For Her Fans: Kate Winslet</span></h2><p class=p1>Kate Winslet is known for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">totally and utterly ignoring her fans</a>. She doesn’t make eye contact or give them the time of day. Honestly, it sounds pretty rude! Kate Winslet is an award-winning actress who has taken home awards including the&nbsp;Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress Motion Picture Drama.</p><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Harry Potter: Kate Winslet Nearly Played This Character</a></span></p><p class=p1>She also won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.

She has such a loving and caring energy about her, it’s not surprising at all that she acts in a loving way towards her fans as well. <a href=#>She invited a homeless fan to be her date</a> to the MTV Music Video Awards one year and when she was invited to another fan's prom, she invited the student to join her on stage since she wouldn’t be able to attend his prom with him.</p><h2 id=doesn-t-care-for-his-fans-robert-pattinson><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Doesn’t Care For His Fans: Robert Pattinson</span></h2><p class=p1><a href=#>Robert Pattinson</a> has described his Twilight fans as being weird. Just to be clear, he has not spoken poorly about his fans from other movies that he has starred in... <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">But he isn’t too proud of the work he did in the Twilight movie franchise</a> and thinks that fans of the franchise are fairly weird people. Twilight movies really put him on the map though... it is true that the franchise is pretty cringe-worthy and creepy, especially now looking back on it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=loves-his-fans-justin-bieber><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Loves His Fans: Justin Bieber</span></h2><p class=p1><a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> loves his fans!

When her fans approach her for pictures and autographs, she constantly refuses all of the above. She made the claim that if she did it for one fan, she would have to do it for all her fans and that simply isn’t in her best interest. At one premiere evemt, <a href=#>she even lectured her fans</a> about how dumb autographs are.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=loves-her-fans-lady-gaga><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Loves Her Fans: Lady Gaga</span></h2><p class=p1><a href=#>Lady Gaga</a> totally loves her fan base. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Her fans are known as “Little Monsters”</a>.

Although his fans adore him a lot and would love to get autographs and pictures with him, he doesn’t care to take the time out of his day to do those things. It is reported that he decides which fans are worthy of autographs based on their appearances. <a href=#>Fans have called him a jerk</a>&nbsp;in the past for his behavior.</p><p class=p1><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Madonna Takes Fans On A Tour Of Sassy Moments</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl8Buw8eoZJqcn6eybsDHnqCrZZaWu7R51qGmZpmimru1edWeqbJlnp6wpns%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcelebs-who-adore-their-fans-who-arent-very-nice.html&text=5%20Celebs%20Who%20Adore%20Their%20Fans%20%28%26amp%3b%205%20Who%20Aren%27t%20Very%20Nice%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcelebs-who-adore-their-fans-who-arent-very-nice.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcelebs-who-adore-their-fans-who-arent-very-nice.html&title=5%20Celebs%20Who%20Adore%20Their%20Fans%20%28%26amp%3b%205%20Who%20Aren%27t%20Very%20Nice%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcelebs-who-adore-their-fans-who-arent-very-nice.html&title=5%20Celebs%20Who%20Adore%20Their%20Fans%20%28%26amp%3b%205%20Who%20Aren%27t%20Very%20Nice%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcelebs-who-adore-their-fans-who-arent-very-nice.html&title=5%20Celebs%20Who%20Adore%20Their%20Fans%20%28%26amp%3b%205%20Who%20Aren%27t%20Very%20Nice%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcelebs-who-adore-their-fans-who-arent-very-nice.html&description=5%20Celebs%20Who%20Adore%20Their%20Fans%20%28%26amp%3b%205%20Who%20Aren%27t%20Very%20Nice%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alex-ruygrok-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-401687-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alex Ruygrok Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./15-little-known-facts-about-triple-hs-relationship-with-vince-mcmahon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Little-Known Facts About Triple Hs Relationship With Vince McMahon">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
