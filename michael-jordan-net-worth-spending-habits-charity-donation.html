The father of five has amassed a massive net worth since his NBA days and currently ranks among the wealthiest athletes in the world. With such deep pockets, fans must be curious about how Jordan spends his money. As it turns out, the way Jordan uses his wealth is just as impressive as the amount he has. Here’s why, though not immune to splurging on luxury cars and multi-million-dollar properties, Jordan can never be accused of not using his money for the greater good.</p><h2 id=just-how-much-is-michael-jordan-really-worth>Just How Much Is Michael Jordan Really Worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/michael-jordan-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>NBA legend Michael Jordan's net worth has evoked endless fascination from fans since his NBA days, when he was reportedly taking home millions each year. By the time he retired from the NBA for the third and final time in the early 2000s, Jordan's net worth had grown to about $500 million, and was showing no signs of dwindling out.</p><p>Owing to multiple lucrative investments, particularly his massive stake in the NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets, and his longstanding partnership with the footwear mega-brand Nike, Jordan is currently worth a whopping $2.2 billion. This staggering figure makes him not only the wealthiest athlete alive, but also places him at par with some of the richest people in the world.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Juanita Vanoy's Net Worth Skyrocketed Following Her Divorce Settlement From Michael Jordan</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-jordan-donates-a-huge-chunk-of-his-net-worth-on-philanthropy>Michael Jordan Donates A Huge Chunk Of His Net Worth On Philanthropy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/michael-jordan-donovan-russel-make-a-wish.jpg><p>With such a massive net worth, it should come as no surprise that Michael Jordan leads an exceptionally opulent life. The father of five has purchased everything from luxury homes, top-of-the-line sports cars, and even his own private golf course. That said, Jordan has also earned a reputation for being one of the most charitable billionaires out there.</p><p>In February this year, Jordan stunned the world when he celebrated his 60th birthday by donating a staggering $10 million to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">For the past 34 years, it’s been an honor to partner with Make-A-Wish and help bring a smile and happiness to so many kids</a>,” he said in a statement at the time. “Witnessing their strength and resilience during such a tough time in their lives has truly been an inspiration. I can’t think of a better birthday gift than seeing others join me in supporting Make-A-Wish so that every child can experience the magic of having their wish come true.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jordan’s generosity is not restricted to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Amid the Black Lives Matter protests, Jordan donated $1 million to the Institute for Community-Police Relations and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. To further demonstrate his commitment to social justice, Jordan also pledged to donate an impressive $100 million over the course of a decade to organizations fighting for "racial equality, social justice, and greater access to education."</p><h2 id=what-michael-jordan-donates-to-his-home-state>What Michael Jordan Donates To His Home State</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/michael-jordan-and-wife.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As evidenced by the large sums of money he’s poured out in donations over the years, Michael Jordan’s generosity knows no bounds. However, some causes are especially close to the NBA legend's heart, especially those involving his home state of North Carolina. For over a decade, the father of five has hosted a celebrity golf tournament in Charlotte to raise money for some of his favorite charities, including Keep Memory Alive, Make-A-Wish, the James R. Jordan Foundation, the NBA’s Charlotte Bobcats’ charity arm, and Opportunity Village.</p><p>In 2019, the NBA mega-star donated a whopping $7.2 million to aid in the construction of two Novant Health clinics to offer crucial health services to underinsured and uninsured persons in Charlotte, North Carolina. "It's not the financials but [it's] from the heart — a passion from what this city, this state has given back to me," Jordan said of his donation at the time. "I can never repay what you have given to me. But this is a start." The two clinics commenced operations in late 2019, and were a vital resource in Charlotte’s COVID-19 response.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Barely two years later, Jordan donated an additional $10 million to establish two more Novant clinics, this time in Wilmington, North Carolina. "Everyone should have access to quality health care, no matter where they live, or whether or not they have insurance,” he said at the time. “Wilmington holds a special place in my heart, and it's truly gratifying to be able to give back to the community that supported me throughout my life."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Does Michael Jordan Feel About Larsa Pippen Dating His Son Marcus?</a></span></p><p>Jordan was also more than happy to lend a helping hand when Hurricane Florence ravaged his home state, causing at least 25 deaths in North Carolina alone. “It’s truly devastating to see the damage the Hurricane Florence is doing to my beloved home state of North Carolina and to the surrounding areas,” Jordan said in a statement at the time. “The recovery effort will be massive, and it will take a long time to repair the damage and for the families to get back on their feet.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The NBA superstar also showed up for his home state amid the COVID-19 pandemic, donating $2 million of the proceeds from his Emmy-winning docuseries, The Last Dance, to food banks in Chicago and the Carolinas. “In these challenging times and in a year of unimaginable difficulty due to Covid-19, it’s more important than ever to pause and give thanks,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he said of the donation</a> at the time. “I am proud to be donating additional proceeds from The Last Dance to Feeding America and its member food banks in the Carolinas and Chicago to help feed America’s hungry.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikopuYlrKtecmoqZ2ZnmK7psCMsKarrJhiwLGxzZ2gp59dna6jtdOsZJygkae2tcWMnaanmaSevK97</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmichael-jordan-net-worth-spending-habits-charity-donation.html&text=Michael%20Jordan%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Is%20Massive%2c%20But%20The%20Way%20He%20Spends%20It%20Has%20Fans%20Smiling%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-jordan-net-worth-spending-habits-charity-donation.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-jordan-net-worth-spending-habits-charity-donation.html&title=Michael%20Jordan%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Is%20Massive%2c%20But%20The%20Way%20He%20Spends%20It%20Has%20Fans%20Smiling%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmichael-jordan-net-worth-spending-habits-charity-donation.html&title=Michael%20Jordan%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Is%20Massive%2c%20But%20The%20Way%20He%20Spends%20It%20Has%20Fans%20Smiling%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-jordan-net-worth-spending-habits-charity-donation.html&title=Michael%20Jordan%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Is%20Massive%2c%20But%20The%20Way%20He%20Spends%20It%20Has%20Fans%20Smiling%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-jordan-net-worth-spending-habits-charity-donation.html&description=Michael%20Jordan%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Is%20Massive%2c%20But%20The%20Way%20He%20Spends%20It%20Has%20Fans%20Smiling%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./natalia-bryant-received-gift-from-kobe-and-gianna-for-her-21st-birthday.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Natalia Bryant Received Gift From Kobe and Gianna for Her 21st Birthday">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./margaret-qualley.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Margaret Qualley News - Us Weekly">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
