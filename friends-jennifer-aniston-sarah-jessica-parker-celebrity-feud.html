Numerous other sources, however, have claimed that there is a feud between the two television icons but they are all basing their reporting on Heat World's article.</p><p>Nevertheless, Heat World claimed that the alleged feud between Sarah Jessica Parker and Jennifer Aniston stems from the completion between them in their careers in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jennifer-aniston-was-forced-into-a-rivalry-with-sarah-jessica-parker-while-on-friends.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This accusation isn't exactly without merits.

The goal is simple: to be the face of the number one scripted streaming program for certain-aged women.

The insider told Heat World that both Aniston and Parker take their And Just Like That and Morning Show competition personally, and that it's a matter of "pride" for each of them. However, neither star has addressed this publicly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, quite simply, it seems as though Aniston and Parker are not in a feud whatsoever.</p><h2 id=are-jennifer-aniston-and-sarah-jessica-parker-friends>Are Jennifer Aniston And Sarah Jessica Parker Friends?</h2><p>Jennifer Aniston and Sarah Jessica Parker certainly come from the same generation of Hollywood stars.
