One of her first high-profile relationships was with another singer, Jack Gilinsky. At the time, she was just a teenager, and although things did not end well, the former couple had been together for almost two years before their breakup.

According to Cosmopolitan, their relationship started in 2015 after they met at a party through a mutual friend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/madison-beer-and-jack-gilinsky-1.jpg><p>Beer has reflected upon how they met during an interview with W magazine, telling the publication that Nash Grier introduced them. "And we actually went on a vacation together with two other people, and there was no tension, nothing weird, no kissing, nothing — it was just like friends chilling, hanging out, and I had a little bit of a crush on him," she explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I remember my dad called me, and we were fighting, and this guy who was there was like, 'This is why I would never date a 15-year-old.' And I was so mad because I thought, what if Jack heard that and doesn't want to date me anymore? Then fast-forward probably like a month or two later, we told each other we liked each other a lot, and it was really cute! When he told me that, he was on tour, and we officially started dating when he got home, so we've been together for like a year now."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Despite Massive TikTok Success, Madison Beer Says The Platform Is 'Ruining Music'</a></span></p><p>They would date for almost two years, finally splitting in 2017. Their breakup was not without controversy either, and Jack Gilinsky reportedly had a recording of him leaked in which he had been verbally abusive to Madison Beer.</p><p>According to People Magazine, around the time of the recording, Beer took to social media to share a message (which was later deleted) saying, ​​"Don't make the same mistakes I did, your safety is never worth it.

According to Hollywood Life, in 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they were spotted on a lunch date</a>, and Gilinsky is reported to have leaned over to kiss Beer on her lips. An action that the publication claims was not a "friendly peck" between friends either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/madison-beer-and-jack-gilinsky.jpg><p>But both she and Gilinsky have since moved on. <a href=#>Beer is dating Nick Austin</a> (and has been for almost two years since first being linked in 2020), and in 2023, she gave an interview about their relationship with InStyle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'm<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> super happy within my relationship</a>, and I feel really safe, and I feel like I'm with someone I consider my best friend, which is very important," she said. "In the past, I haven't really spent 'friend time' with my boyfriend, whereas now, I kind of do. So, it feels good."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Madison Beer Openly Has A Crush On These Two Hot Celebrities</a></span></p><p>In 2022, it was revealed that Jack Gilinsky would become a father. The baby mama is Geneva Natalia, and the couple shared their exciting news on social media in August 2022 before they welcomed their daughter a month later.</p><h2 id=who-is-jack-gilinsky-39-s-current-partner-and-baby-mama-geneva-natalia>Who Is Jack Gilinsky's Current Partner And Baby Mama Geneva Natalia?</h2><p>Jack Gilinsky is dating model Geneva Natalia, who according to J-14, is represented by Two Management.

This includes Gilinsky posting photos of himself and a pregnant Natalia looking very loved up. He captioned the post telling fans: "i wrote & recorded a song with baby mama on my lap (sic)."</p><p>He has also shared several photos of them together as a family, along with their daughter, whom he adores.</p><p>If you have been wondering if there was any overlap between Madison Beer and Geneva Natalia, who could have possibly known each other, it seems incredibly unlikely. The former couple broke up several years before Gilinsky and Natalia were ever linked, and it does not appear that either of them was still hung up on their past relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/madison-beer-and-jack-gilinsky-2.jpg><p>The outcome is positive for all involved parties. Gilinsky has started a family and appears to be incredibly happy, and Beer is happy and comfortable in her own relationship with Nick Austin. No need for speculation here! They both continue to have massive fan interest in them and appear to be doing well for themselves.</p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Beer's estimated net worth is $18 million (already $2 million more than <a href=#>estimated less than two years ago</a>). As for Jack Gilinsky? While Celebrity Net Worth does not estimate his earnings to be anywhere as high as his ex-girlfriend, he is believed to have an impressive $2 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmpyZqLyvecGenKtlmpawrHnGoqOipqOgxm6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mmZqaqWK6ornAZp6eppWrrm66wK2YpaGRZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmadison-beer-jack-gilinsky-relationship-baby-mama-geneva-natalia.html&text=Did%20Madison%20Beer%20Know%20Jack%20Gilinsky%27s%20Baby%20Mama%20Geneva%20Natalia%20When%20They%20Were%20Still%20Dating%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmadison-beer-jack-gilinsky-relationship-baby-mama-geneva-natalia.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmadison-beer-jack-gilinsky-relationship-baby-mama-geneva-natalia.html&title=Did%20Madison%20Beer%20Know%20Jack%20Gilinsky%27s%20Baby%20Mama%20Geneva%20Natalia%20When%20They%20Were%20Still%20Dating%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmadison-beer-jack-gilinsky-relationship-baby-mama-geneva-natalia.html&title=Did%20Madison%20Beer%20Know%20Jack%20Gilinsky%27s%20Baby%20Mama%20Geneva%20Natalia%20When%20They%20Were%20Still%20Dating%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmadison-beer-jack-gilinsky-relationship-baby-mama-geneva-natalia.html&title=Did%20Madison%20Beer%20Know%20Jack%20Gilinsky%27s%20Baby%20Mama%20Geneva%20Natalia%20When%20They%20Were%20Still%20Dating%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmadison-beer-jack-gilinsky-relationship-baby-mama-geneva-natalia.html&description=Did%20Madison%20Beer%20Know%20Jack%20Gilinsky%27s%20Baby%20Mama%20Geneva%20Natalia%20When%20They%20Were%20Still%20Dating%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dominic-purcells-dating-history.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dominic Purcells Dating History | Us Weekly">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./are-demi-moore-and-bruce-willis-actually-friends.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Bruce Willis And Demi Moore Actually Stay On Good Terms Post-Divorce?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
