He became interested in music at a young age, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and he was especially good at playing the drums.</a> Collins started out in the music business as a child actor in the 1960s. He was in a number of TV shows and stage productions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Collins joined the rock band Flaming Youth as their drummer in the late 1960s because he loved music so much. This was the start of his career as a professional musician. But his meteoric rise to fame and wealth began when he joined the progressive rock band Genesis as their drummer and later as their lead singer.</p><h2 id=phil-collins-joined-genesis-as-a-drummer><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Phil Collins Joined Genesis As A Drummer</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/phil-collins-2.jpg><p>Phil Collins joined Genesis in 1970, initially as their drummer. The band had already established a dedicated following in the progressive rock scene, but their lives were about to change, and that included Phil Collins'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1975, the lead singer, Peter Gabriel, left Genesis.</a> So the band could continue on, Collins stepped up and took on the dual role of both drummer and lead vocalist. TBH nobody saw that coming, but what an incredible twist of fate it was.</p><p>Under Collins' leadership, Genesis underwent a creative shift, embracing a more pop-oriented sound. This transformation paid off handsomely, as the band went on to achieve success like never before with hit albums like A Trick of the Tail (1976) and Duke (1980). However, it was the album Invisible Touch (1986) that launched Genesis to global stardom.</p><p>Invisible Touch produced chart-topping hits like "Land of Confusion" and "In Too Deep" that are still played today and record-breaking sales. Stereogum says that Invisible Touch hit number one in the UK and number three on the US Billboard 200. It has sold more than 1.2 million copies in the UK and 6 million copies in the US, making it the band's best-selling album to date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Collins' work as the singer, songwriter, and drummer for Genesis was by far the reason for the band's success. His unique voice and the lyrics in the music he wrote really connected with people, and it showed.</p><h2 id=phil-collins-39-net-worth-grew-with-his-solo-career-and-chart-topping-albums><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Phil Collins' Net Worth Grew With His Solo Career And Chart-Topping Albums</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/phil-collins-3-1.jpg><p>While still a member of Genesis, Phil Collins embarked on a solo career that would further add to his bank account. In 1981, he released his debut solo album, Face Value, which included the iconic hit "In the Air Tonight." This song was popular not only because it's a great song but also because of all the stories behind it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In most stories, it has been said that Phil Collins witnessed a man murder another man. He could have saved this man from drowning but didn't get involved and then invited the murderer to one of his concerts. It's completely out of this world, we know. The<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> song is about him getting divorced</a>. Sorry to disappoint.</p><p>Collins continued to release chart-topping solo albums throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including No Jacket Required (1985) and ...But Seriously (1989). These albums featured a string of hit singles, such as "Sussudio," "One More Night," and "Another Day in Paradise." His ability to create emotion through his music is incredible. All of these songs are still known and most certainly contributed significantly to Phil Collins' net worth.</p><h2 id=phil-collins-39-momentous-collaborations-paid-well><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Phil Collins' Momentous Collaborations Paid Well</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/phil-collins-event.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Phil Collins' financial success is due in part to how versatile he is as a musician and how willing he is to work with other artists from different genres. His work as a drummer has been in high demand; artists from Eric Clapton to Brand X have asked him to play drums on their songs and albums.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>Paul Simon's Graceland Album Controversy Made Him An Absolute Fortune</a></span></p><p>Phil Collins' work with Disney also turned out to be very profitable. He worked on the music for the 1999 animated movie Tarzan, which won an Oscar for the song "You'll Be in My Heart."

His tours consistently sold out venues all over, which made him a lot of money. The No Jacket Required tour he did in 1985 and 1986 made him $90 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. That tour was actually one of the most profitable tours of the decade.</p><p>Collins kept touring and performing even though <a href=#>he had recurring health problems</a> that started in 2009, like back and neck problems that affected his nerve endings and made it <a href=#>hard for him to play the drums as he can barely hold the drumsticks.</a> However, his Not Dead Yet Tour (2017â€“2019) showed how popular he still is and how determined he is to continue entertaining the masses.</p><h2 id=music-publishing-and-royalties-give-phil-collins-a-consistent-revenue-stream><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Music Publishing And Royalties Give Phil Collins A Consistent Revenue Stream</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/phil-collins-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Phil Collins' net worth today is largely due to his work in music publishing and royalties from numerous hit albums and songs, which are important parts of his wealth.

He put the house on the market for $40 million in December 2020, but he only ended up with $39 million. Collins has put money into a number of luxury real estate properties around the world.
