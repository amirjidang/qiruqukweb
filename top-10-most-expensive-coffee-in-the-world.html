It is very popular with people of all ages, especially to those who require an energy boost. Coffee is also one of the most common produces of many different countries all around the globe. Nowadays, coffee is available in many different varieties, with variations in terms of quality, taste, and flavor. However, these qualities are not the only ones that set them apart from each other; there is also the price that you have to pay for to be able to enjoy them.</p><p>If you are a coffee-drinker and lover, it’ll be good to know about the most expensive types of coffee in the world.

Luwak Coffee (Indonesia) - $160/lb.</b></h2><p>Luwak Coffee, also commonly referred to as civet coffee, deserves the number one spot on this list of the top ten most expensive coffee in the world, not only because of its extremely expensive price tag but because of its uncommon means of production. This particular type of coffee is produced from the coffee beans that have been consumed by a certain animal, which is the mongoose. Before it can be produced, the coffee beans would have to first pass through the digestive system of the animals. From there, production can begin. This extremely expensive coffee, which costs $160 per pound, has gained extreme popularity all over the world. In the United States, you will find a coffee shop that sells civet coffee. As strange as you may find it to be, you will not find any other type of coffee as costly as the Luwak Coffee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9Oop2ZpYGK6sL%2FTZpyxqJWjwKrCxGaaqJ6WmrJutc1mq6GdXay8s7jDaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftop-10-most-expensive-coffee-in-the-world.html&text=Top%2010%20Most%20Expensive%20Coffee%20in%20the%20World&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftop-10-most-expensive-coffee-in-the-world.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftop-10-most-expensive-coffee-in-the-world.html&title=Top%2010%20Most%20Expensive%20Coffee%20in%20the%20World" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftop-10-most-expensive-coffee-in-the-world.html&title=Top%2010%20Most%20Expensive%20Coffee%20in%20the%20World" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftop-10-most-expensive-coffee-in-the-world.html&title=Top%2010%20Most%20Expensive%20Coffee%20in%20the%20World" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftop-10-most-expensive-coffee-in-the-world.html&description=Top%2010%20Most%20Expensive%20Coffee%20in%20the%20World" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./twitch-does-jschlatt-have-a-gun-what-state-does-he-live-his-biography-details.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Twitch: Does Jschlatt Have A Gun  What State Does He Live  His Biography Details">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./2021-todd-chrisleys-wiki-his-children-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Todd Chrisleys Wiki: His Children and Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
