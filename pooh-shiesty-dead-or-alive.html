He stands lucky in this thing, particularly as he quickly became popular in hip-hop; credit goes to all his skilled talent and unique style that people loved from all over the country. He luckily touched remarkable success, like signing with Gucci Mane’s 1017 Records and Atlantic Records, but Shiesty’s path was always challenging all the way long. Reports are circulating if he is dead or alive. The famous star Pooh is alive and doing good.</p><h2>Pooh Dealing with Legal Issues</h2><p>Pooh’s journey was always challenging. Going in and off, he had to deal with legal settings.</p><p>Pooh Shiesty’s troubled story again revolves around his legal trouble where. He was sentenced to five years and three months in federal prison after he admitted that he was guilty of a firearms conspiracy, which was a charge linked to an incident at a hotel in Florida in 2020. Those charges also included drug trafficking and violence. This showed how serious things he did back then. He’s in prison, dealing with the troubles he created for himself. Reports say that</p><p>Pooh Shiesty was indicted in June 2021 on four counts related to the 2020 shooting at the Landon Hotel in Bay Harbor Islands, Florida.</p><p>He admitted that he genuinely planned to use guns for drug-related crimes and violence. He could have been stuck in jail for up to twenty years, but a deal saved him as prosecutors dropped his three charges, including that one important one that could have meant life in jail. All these charges were for three different incidents he was involved in.</p><h2>Emotional Turns in Pooh’s Family</h2><p>Shiesty’s personal life and versatile career are also profoundly concerned with his family. They have also supported him and admired him. But the grief that hit him and his family was the tragic loss of his cousin Big Scarr and his brother Tee Da P due to brain cancer. Both lost their life to cancer. This incident marks an emotional turn in his family.</p><p>These tragic events faced in life didn’t just affect his music, but it also showed that the rapper is both sensitive and strong.</p><h2>Pooh’s Musical Career</h2><p>He was born on November 8, 1999; Pooh Shiesty’s career so far is a testament to how strongly he was influenced by his heritage and the environment where he was brought up, as it shaped him as an artist’s journey. He was raised in a musically linked family where his father was in rap; looking at his rap and career makes him feel that Shiesty was meant to be in the music industry. Because he grew up in the Cane Creek Apartments, where he spent time in Pflugerville, Texas, all these real-life experiences added depth and truth to his music. People from all over the world connect with it through his fantastic rap.</p><h2>Pooh’s Message of Hope From Jail</h2><p>Although Pooh is in jail now, he still has stated hope from behind the bars on his Instagram. Which shows that his Spirit still shines Bright.</p><p>“King Shiesty tappin in from the middle of the pennititary aka Hell where they say I cant go, jailing no telling!!”</p><p>I remain untouched, and millions are still in double digits! Tell Google to fix my net worth. We can verify that shit right now. Yeah, I’m locked up, not fucked up. I was 21, up eight figures; Jay-Z can’t even relate. My money triples my followers.</p><p>Pooh continued, “I’m still the Menace of Memphis, Still the King no matter what jungle. Slick almost the same n***a just a lil mo powerful. You n***a cant beat me at crawling backwards. You gone have to get yo hand, knife, and gun game up before you can do some with me stop playing so much!”</p><p>While concluding his message, he thanked his dear fans for their support and Love.</p><span id=tbmarker></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7trzTqKqpnZWZt7DB0aeYpaGjonuku8xopZ6vo2S9sLvHZqqhoZWowbp5w56YnWWfp3qiuMivnGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpooh-shiesty-dead-or-alive.html&text=Who%20is%20Pooh%20Shiesty%3f%20Is%20He%20Dead%20or%20Alive%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpooh-shiesty-dead-or-alive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpooh-shiesty-dead-or-alive.html&title=Who%20is%20Pooh%20Shiesty%3f%20Is%20He%20Dead%20or%20Alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpooh-shiesty-dead-or-alive.html&title=Who%20is%20Pooh%20Shiesty%3f%20Is%20He%20Dead%20or%20Alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpooh-shiesty-dead-or-alive.html&title=Who%20is%20Pooh%20Shiesty%3f%20Is%20He%20Dead%20or%20Alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpooh-shiesty-dead-or-alive.html&description=Who%20is%20Pooh%20Shiesty%3f%20Is%20He%20Dead%20or%20Alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./shakur-stevenson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Shakur Stevenson dating?
