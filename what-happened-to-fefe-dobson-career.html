Her self-titled debut album was a smash hit. Not just in Canada but in the States as well. Her punk rock/pop flavor was something fresh and exciting at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With singles like "Bye Bye Boyfriend" and "Take Me Away", the then-18-year-old was faced with fame that she couldn't imagine in her wildest dreams. The world seemed ready for her, expecting great things. And yet, her career didn't quite go down the path seemingly laid out for her.</p><p>There's no doubt that Fefe has found ways of coming back, especially with her 2022 hit "FCKN IN LOVE". But in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Vulture</a>, Fefe explained just how much of an emotional toll her fall from the spotlight took. But even before that, the Canadian singer faced scrutiny no one (especially at that age) should deal with...</p><h2 id=the-music-industry-didn-39-t-know-where-to-put-fefe-dobson>The Music Industry Didn't Know Where To Put Fefe Dobson</h2><p>During <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a 2004 interview with The Observer</a>, Fefe Dobson shed light on how people in the music industry tried to fit her into a box right off the bat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Before I was signed, people would look at me, and go, 'Oh my God, you’re going to be the next R&B singer.' And then when I sang, people were like, 'You have a pop voice, you can be the next <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>.'"</p><p>Without a doubt, this caused Fefe notable emotional distress. She wasn't sure of herself during a time the world couldn't figure her out. And on top of this, she was exposed to extreme scrutiny.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I definitely had identity issues and that was mainly because, I’m 18 years old at that point, and thrown into this world where there’s photos of you and you’re online and people can see your flaws and your clothes maybe didn’t fit that great that day," Fefe explained to Vulture.</p><p>And then there was the fact that Fefe was constantly compared to <a href=#>the now extremely wealthy Avril Lavigne</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Avril Lavigne Is All About The Beach Life With Her $7.8 Million Malibu Home</a></span></p><p>"Avril and I came out around the same time and we’re both Canadian. When I saw her I was like, 'Oh my God, she’s so beautiful. How am I gonna compete with this girl?'"</p><h2 id=fefe-dobson-didn-39-t-think-she-was-quot-beautiful-enough-quot>Fefe Dobson Didn't Think She Was "Beautiful Enough"</h2><p>Constantly comparing herself to other female artists, namely Avril, caused Fefe to develop some issues around her image and self-worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I didn’t know 100 percent how it would affect me, coming out so young and not really knowing myself. When the video for “Take Me Away” came out, I literally cried in my manager’s office because I didn’t think I looked beautiful and I was so petrified of that," Fefe told Vulture.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sydney Sweeney Was Attacked For Her Weight For This Utterly Ridiculous Reason</a></span></p><p>"Growing up, my mom’s white, my brothers are white, and my dad’s Black but he was never around. My Blackness was never really celebrated and I was never taught to appreciate those features, so that was hard. It wasn’t their fault, it’s just when you’re the only one that’s different in your household, you need more. You need to be told and taught and encouraged on a different level."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-fefe-dobson>What Happened To Fefe Dobson?</h2><p>There's no question that Fefe Dobson's career has not been as full-throttle as everyone expected it to be when she first became famous. Surprisingly, part of this was her doing...</p><p>"In 2014, me and my team — my manager, band, label — released a few songs and we were gonna release an album called Firebird. During that time, I went through a transitional period and we didn’t end up releasing it," Fefe admitted to Vulture.</p><p>Following this, Fefe slowly kept retooling her sound and reintroducing herself to the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Then I made another album in Tennessee, which was more indie-rock, and I also didn’t put that out. I put out a song called “Save Me From LA,” and then another song, “Born to You,” got on Riverdale … I keep doing that a lot. I’ll be writing albums, and then I’m like, You know what? I don’t know if this is right yet. So it’s definitely a reintroduction to who I am and my sound and everything that comes with me from the past."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Exactly What Happened To Prince's Insane Net Worth After He Died</a></span></p><p>Of course, Fefe's most popular moment in time was between 2003-2005. This success would have continued had her record label not canceled the release of her second studio album. The decision resulted in Fefe going out on her own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It took until the release of her album "Joy" in 2010 for her to be signed by another label. But the pain she suffered from that cancelation left its mark.</p><p>"When it first happened, for sure there was disappointment and I was trying to figure out what went wrong. And even for years after, it was the same thing; it was kind of hard for me to even listen to the album," Fefe said. "A song would come on and I would have anxiety about it for days."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To Nelly? Here's What The Rapper Is Doing Today</a></span></p><p>While she's not over the decision, she has learned to have an "appreciation" for the canceled songs. Mainly because other artists covered them so well.</p><p>"I’ve come to a place with that album where I have an appreciation for it now. It happened for a reason. I realized through “As a Blonde” for <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> and “Don’t Let It Go to Your Head” for Jordin Sparks, and all the amazing women that ended up celebrating it, it became something bigger."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brLEn5xmnJ%2BXwLC6jJyYq52Vp3w%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-fefe-dobson-career.html&text=How%20Fefe%20Dobson%20Transcended%20An%20Endless%20Barrage%20Of%20Hate%20And%20Disappointment%20During%20Her%20Career&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-fefe-dobson-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-fefe-dobson-career.html&title=How%20Fefe%20Dobson%20Transcended%20An%20Endless%20Barrage%20Of%20Hate%20And%20Disappointment%20During%20Her%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-fefe-dobson-career.html&title=How%20Fefe%20Dobson%20Transcended%20An%20Endless%20Barrage%20Of%20Hate%20And%20Disappointment%20During%20Her%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-fefe-dobson-career.html&title=How%20Fefe%20Dobson%20Transcended%20An%20Endless%20Barrage%20Of%20Hate%20And%20Disappointment%20During%20Her%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-fefe-dobson-career.html&description=How%20Fefe%20Dobson%20Transcended%20An%20Endless%20Barrage%20Of%20Hate%20And%20Disappointment%20During%20Her%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-did-johnny-depp-spend-on-his-and-amber-heards-wedding.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Did Johnny Depp Spend On His And Amber Heard's Wedding?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./holly-madison-bridgets-girls-next-door-podcast-revelations.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Holly Madison, Bridget's 'Girls Next Door' Podcast Revelations">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
