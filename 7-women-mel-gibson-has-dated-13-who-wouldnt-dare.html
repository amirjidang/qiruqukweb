Despite his past problematic ways, he’s still coveted after when it comes to his directorial projects (Hacksaw Ridge which ended up winning two Academy Awards and a lot of praise) and comedy acting (Daddy’s Home 2).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In case you didn’t already know, he’s had a VERY interesting personal and dating life. He’s the father of (count ‘em) nine children, but could that have been more if he actually dated some very famous women in his life?</p><p>Here are 7 women who fell under Mad Max’s spell, and 13 who straight up said: “Oh, no thank you very much”.</p><h2 id=head-over-heels-rosalind-ross><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Head Over Heels: Rosalind Ross</span></h2><p>This is the current love of Mel’s life – former champion equestrian vaulter and mother of his ninth child, Rosalind Ross. Okay, she happens to be significantly younger than Mel (like over 30 years younger) but they don’t seem to let that get in the way of their courtship. He’s been dating her for several years and they seem to be very much in love.</p><h2 id=head-over-heels-robyn-moore><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Head Over Heels: Robyn Moore</span></h2><p>Robyn Moore was a dental nurse when she met Mel who was then a struggling actor who had yet to hit the fame jackpot. The two married in the summer of 1980 and went strong for 26 years until they separated in 2006 thanks to rumors of him cheating. The two have seven children together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=head-over-heels-nadia-lanfranconi><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Head Over Heels: Nadia Lanfranconi</span></h2><p>Mel Gibson definitely has a certain type of woman he chases after. Back in 2012, Mel went on a string of dates with a young Italian musician named Nadia Lanfranconi. He was even caught giving the young singer-songwriter a neck massage at a popular Hollywood restaurant. The relationship didn’t last very long, though.</p><h2 id=head-over-heels-violet-kowal><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Head Over Heels: Violet Kowal</span></h2><p>It’s not really wise to cheat on a partner when you’re one of the most famous faces in the world, but, alas, this appears to be what happened with Mel. Polish adult film actress Violet Kowal went on the record to say that she and Mel had a fling when he was with then-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva. His rep called the affair “absurd”.</p><h2 id=head-over-heels-oksana-grigorieva><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Head Over Heels: Oksana Grigorieva</span></h2><p>Mel was technically still married when he started seeing Russian pianist Oksana Grigorieva, but when the two were photographed sharing an intimate moment on a beach, Moore ended up filing for divorce in 2009. Their relationship was a rocky one and Grigorieva accused Mel of domestic violence. It was a rant against her that was the starting block of his troubles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=head-over-heels-leslie-hamel><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Head Over Heels: Leslie Hamel</span></h2><p>It has appeared that Mel led sort of a double life while he was married to Moore, which included a secret relationship with actress Suzanne Somers’ step-daughter, Leslie Hamel. Hamel’s biological mother, Marilyn Hamel, confirm that her daughter was with Mel for a period of time and went as far as to say she was introduced to him by Leslie.</p><h2 id=head-over-heels-diana-alouise><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Head Over Heels: Diana Alouise</span></h2><p>Another former mistress of Mel’s stepped forward after all the trouble with the actor started arising in towards the end of the 2000s decade. Diana Alouise, who is a stand-up comic, admitted to having a four-month affair with the actor back in 2004. She referred to him as “a cheater” to the Enquirer and that he can’t really help himself because he’s an addict.</p><h2 id=no-chance-jodie-foster><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>No Chance: Jodie Foster</span></h2><p>Mel Gibson is a good looking man who has had his share of beautiful co-stars and friends, one of whom is actress/director Jodie Foster. Foster, who publicly stood up for Mel when his troubles started snowballing, cast Mel in her film The Beaver and his one of his biggest supporters. But that’s all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-chance-julia-roberts><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>No Chance: Julia Roberts</span></h2><p>This one makes sense – as in, they would look good together as a couple, but it just wasn’t meant to be. Julia Roberts was Mel’s leading lady in Conspiracy Theory, but both were in relationships/marriages at the time. Their chemistry was undeniable and, of course, rumors started, but both parties say that friendship is all that’s between them.</p><h2 id=no-chance-maria-bello><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>No Chance: Maria Bello</span></h2><p>During the 90s and the early 2000s, Mel was starring in movies with some famous, and very beautiful, women, one of whom was Maria Bello of Coyote Ugly fame. Both starred in the 1999 thriller Payback. At the time, Mel was running around on his first wife, Maria was with boyfriend Dan McDermott, and she seems like the type to knock someone out for cheating.</p><h2 id=no-chance-rene-russo><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>No Chance: Rene Russo</span></h2><p>Actress Rene Russo happens to be one of Mel’s closest female friends and someone who has not only started in numerous films with him but has backed him up on occasion. They both starred in the&nbsp;Lethal Weapon franchise and even got together a couple of years back in order to celebrate the anniversary. But dating? No, never.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-chance-sarah-silverman><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>No Chance: Sarah Silverman</span></h2><p>While a lot of Hollywood has forgiven Mel Gibson for his appalling past and words, one person has not: comedian Sarah Silverman. When it was announced that Gibson would co-write and direct the remake of the movie The Wild Bunch, Silverman quoted Gibson’s anti-Semitic rant and was backed up by some other powerful women. No love lost between these two.</p><h2 id=no-chance-whoopi-goldberg><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>No Chance: Whoopi Goldberg</span></h2><p>While a lot of the Hollywood elite have either forgiven Mel or simply ignore his past behavior, another woman in his corner is actress Whoopi Goldberg, who, when on The View, loudly backed up her friend when the other women were attacking him on the air. Does this mean there are feelings involved? Highly doubtful. She’s just a good friend.</p><h2 id=no-chance-helen-hunt><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>No Chance: Helen Hunt</span></h2><p>One of Mel’s more memorable romantic comedy roles was in the hit movie What Women Want, where Mel could read the minds of women and begins to use it to his advantage. His romantic interest in the movie was also his competition, played by Helen Hunt. Both had extraordinary chemistry in the movie but it never went beyond that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-chance-goldie-hawn><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>No Chance: Goldie Hawn</span></h2><p>Not many people remember the movie Bird on a Wire, which starred Mel as a man who faked his death in order to get away from some bad guys. Goldie Hawn played the girlfriend he left behind and when he returns to get her out of danger, the two embark on a wild cat and mouse game. During this time, Hawn was with Kurt Russell.</p><h2 id=no-chance-jamie-lee-curtis><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>No Chance: Jamie Lee Curtis</span></h2><p>Mel has been known to have some pretty powerful women friends, even after his career and personal life spiraled into a freefall. Mainly women who he had worked with in the past, like Jamie Lee Curtis, who starred with him in Forever Young. While Curtis is still a friend of Mel’s, she doesn’t really talk about him much (for good reason, we assume).</p><h2 id=no-chance-joanne-samuel><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>No Chance: Joanne Samuel</span></h2><p>You may recognize Joanne Samuel from her appearance as Mel’s wife in the movie Mad Max. “He had ‘it’ – your eyes just went to him,” she said in a radio interview. “He was a lovely actor, a classically trained actor…but he did have that wonderful presence on screen that set him apart.” The two are friends (and only friends) today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-chance-teresa-palmer><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>No Chance: Teresa Palmer</span></h2><p>Just by looking at her, you’d figure that actress Teresa Palmer is EXACTLY Mel’s type of girlfriend these days (she’s way younger than him and has a little bit of the same look that some of his other current girlfriends have). But, nope, she’s just one of the beauties who starred in his film Hacksaw Ridge and gushes over the director.</p><h2 id=no-chance-joely-richardson><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>No Chance: Joely Richardson</span></h2><p>Sure, we all remember the memorable scenes that featured Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger from the movie The Patriot – mainly because they had some good ones playing father and son. But there was also some between Joely Richardson, who played Mel’s late wife’s sister and the aunt to his children. Their chemistry was abstract, but you felt it. Too bad they’re just friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-chance-marisa-tomi><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>No Chance: Marisa Tomi</span></h2><p>Based on the looks of this very photo, actress Marisa Tomi appears to be completely enamored with her former co-star Mel Gibson. They’re walking the red carpet here during the premiere of What Women Want, where Tomi plays, you guessed it, a woman enamored with Mel. Maybe it was just for the sake of the movie? Unfortunately, they too never dated.</p><p>References: dailymail.co.uk, vanityfair.com, hope1032.com.au, indiewire.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhuZq%2BforKvecyeo2afmZfAsLqMoZisZZSWwaawjGpqZq%2BYpHq4u9Slm6esXZmus7GO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f7-women-mel-gibson-has-dated-13-who-wouldnt-dare.html&text=7%20Women%20Mel%20Gibson%20Has%20Dated%20%2813%20Who%20Wouldn%27t%20Dare%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f7-women-mel-gibson-has-dated-13-who-wouldnt-dare.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f7-women-mel-gibson-has-dated-13-who-wouldnt-dare.html&title=7%20Women%20Mel%20Gibson%20Has%20Dated%20%2813%20Who%20Wouldn%27t%20Dare%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f7-women-mel-gibson-has-dated-13-who-wouldnt-dare.html&title=7%20Women%20Mel%20Gibson%20Has%20Dated%20%2813%20Who%20Wouldn%27t%20Dare%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f7-women-mel-gibson-has-dated-13-who-wouldnt-dare.html&title=7%20Women%20Mel%20Gibson%20Has%20Dated%20%2813%20Who%20Wouldn%27t%20Dare%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f7-women-mel-gibson-has-dated-13-who-wouldnt-dare.html&description=7%20Women%20Mel%20Gibson%20Has%20Dated%20%2813%20Who%20Wouldn%27t%20Dare%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alisa-allapach-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-278954-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alisa Allapach Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./15-youngest-celebrity-moms-and-5-oldest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Youngest Celebrity Moms (And 5 Oldest)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
