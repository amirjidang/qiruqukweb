After meeting and marrying Tom, who had originally wanted to become an actor, the couple welcomed three children into their family.</p><p>Sadly, their lives were suddenly turned upside down when Tom decided to leave when Troy was four years old, leaving his wife to become the sole provider for her family.</p><p>Despite the difficult circumstances, she found herself in, Phyllis bravely supported them all through her jobs as a waitress and records clerk.</p><p>Tragically, on July 15, 1989, Phyllis was found dead on the kitchen floor when the family came by to do electrical work at the house in Kenosha.</p><p>Her passing undoubtedly left family and friends devastated by their terrible loss.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who killed Phyllis Bierdz?</h2><p>Troy Bierdz murderer, the youngest child of the family, had a troubled childhood, which included poor treatment of the family dog, drug abuse, regular suspensions at school, and threats of suicide during his early adolescence.</p><p>At the age of 16, he stole his mother’s car and crashed it in Florida. Two years later, he led the police on a high-speed pursuit and cut his arms upon being caught.</p><p>He was subsequently admitted to a psych ward, where he threatened to kill a nurse and talked about killing his brother, Thom, and experiencing what it would feel like to kill someone.</p><p>Although Troy was ultimately diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, it was too late, and he murdered his mother, Phyllis Bierdz, just months after she reported his threatening behavior to the police.</p><p>After killing Phyllis, Troy fled in her car with her purse, painting the car black and stealing number plates from another vehicle.</p><p>He even pawned items found in the trunk to pay for gas and impersonated his brother, Thom, in a 911 call, admitting to killing Phyllis and raping Troy.</p><p>Eventually, the authorities arrested him in Laredo, Texas, and Troy tried to burn off his fingerprints to avoid identification.</p><p>After confessing to the murder, Troy was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. He remains incarcerated at Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, Wisconsin, and will be eligible for parole in 2039.</p><p>In contrast, Thom Bierdz moved out of Wisconsin. He pursued a career as an actor, ultimately landing a role on the popular soap opera, ‘The Young and the Restless,’ playing the character Phillip Chancellor III.</p><p>Although the character was killed off in 1989, Thom was asked to return in the 2000s, becoming the first openly gay actor to play a major openly gay character on a soap opera.</p><p>Thom was devastated by his mother’s murder and initially cut off all contact with his brother.</p><p>However, he visited Troy in prison in 1994 and was shocked by his condition, prompting him to advocate for Troy’s mental health treatment.</p><p>Today, Thom lives in Lake Arrowhead, California, and has shifted his interests to painting and making a living as an artist.</p><p>He has also written and published ‘Forgiving Troy,’ a book that offers insight into the aftermath of the murder and explores mental health issues and Hollywood’s treatment of gay actors.</p><p>Thom is also the president of the American Art Awards and has authored a few other books. Although he has forgiven Troy, he acknowledges that his mother’s murder had a profound impact on his life.</p><p>Troy Bierdz’s troubled childhood and mental health issues ultimately led to him murdering his mother, Phyllis Bierdz.</p><p>He remains incarcerated at Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, Wisconsin, and will be eligible for parole in 2039.</p><p>In contrast, Thom Bierdz pursued a successful career in Hollywood and shifted his interests to painting and writing.</p><p>Although he was devastated by his mother’s murder, he has forgiven his brother and advocates for his mental health treatment.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDA0aiwZpqZmr%2BlxoymrKuclaeys3nCmqqeZaedsrOxjKKqZqCVYruww44%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftroy-bierdz-murderer-case-where-is-he-now.html&text=Troy%20Bierdz%20Murderer%20Case%20%20Where%20Is%20He%20Now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftroy-bierdz-murderer-case-where-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftroy-bierdz-murderer-case-where-is-he-now.html&title=Troy%20Bierdz%20Murderer%20Case%20%20Where%20Is%20He%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftroy-bierdz-murderer-case-where-is-he-now.html&title=Troy%20Bierdz%20Murderer%20Case%20%20Where%20Is%20He%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftroy-bierdz-murderer-case-where-is-he-now.html&title=Troy%20Bierdz%20Murderer%20Case%20%20Where%20Is%20He%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftroy-bierdz-murderer-case-where-is-he-now.html&description=Troy%20Bierdz%20Murderer%20Case%20%20Where%20Is%20He%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./twomad-real-name-wiki-biography-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Twomad Real Name, Wiki, Biography And Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ryan-reynolds-friend-leaked-photos-of-his-kids-to-the-media.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="This Was One Of The Worst Things To Happen To Ryan Reynolds And His Kids">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
