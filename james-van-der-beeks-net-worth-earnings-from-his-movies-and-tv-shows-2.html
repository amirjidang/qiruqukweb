Thankfully, all his hard work paid off and has made James Van Der Beek’s net worth a subject of public scrutiny. The Connecticut-born actor started pretty early in the business with a lead role in the WB series, Dawson’s Creek.</p><p>He was just 20 years old but that was a big one for him. Since then, the star has mostly been associated with the success and recognition he earned thereof. That does not in any way suggest that James hasn’t been doing well for himself since Dawson’s Creek packed up. Check out the current financial status of the star in addition to the movies and tv shows that have helped him acquire his fortune.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-james-van-der-beeks-net-worth></span><strong>What Is James Van Der Beek’s Net Worth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Even though he has been active in the industry for quite a long time, James Van Der Beek’s net worth is not as impressive as some other actors out there. Nevertheless, he is far from a pauper as he has a comfortable net worth of $10 million.</p><p>There are a handful of things that facilitated James’ accumulation of his wealth. Apart from his work in movies, TV and on stage, he has been recognized for a handful of things. Not long past, he was named on a list compiled by People Magazine, among the 50 most beautiful people in the world. Way before that, he won MTV’s Best Breakthrough Performance Award. This was for the work he did as the lead in the movie Varsity Blue&nbsp;(1999). This critically acclaimed movie went on to hold the number 1 spot at the U.S. box office. Even more impressive is the fact that this was for a whopping two weeks after its release.</p><p>He has had a lot more work attributed to his name since then. Some of them have gone on to become quite popular over the years. All in all, his hard work and tenacity are sure to bump that figure up as time goes by.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=james-van-der-beeks-earnings-from-movies-and-tv-shows></span><strong>James Van Der Beek’s Earnings From Movies And TV Shows</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>One thing that is for sure is the fact that the production he is best known for is Dawson’s Creek. So, that is probably the best place to begin. The show itself premiered on WB and ran for a full 6 seasons with the last episode airing on May 14, 2003. Though Dawson’s Creek ran from 1998 to 2003, James Van Der Beek did not really start cashing out from it till 2012. He testified that he was paid close to nothing throughout all its seasons. This was all thanks to a bad contract and lack of experience in showbiz as a whole.</p><p>In fact, he often quips that when the very small fortune he amassed from his time at Dawson Creek ran out, he moved on to Don’t Trust the B—- in Apartment 23. The jokes continue as he stated that he had to audition against 6 contenders for the role of himself. Once that was up and running, the star was raking in about $49,343 every month.</p><p>Apart from these TV shows that obviously made him a household name, there are a bunch of shows securely in his portfolio.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=his-other-movies-and-tv-shows></span><strong>His Other Movies And TV Shows</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>It is hard to tell the actual amount that the actor earned from his other shows. Nevertheless, these have certainly contributed to James Van Der Beek’s net worth. He has appeared in quite an extensive number of productions over the years. In 2002, he went on to play the part of Sean Bateman in the film adaptation of the book, Rules of Attraction. The film received very mixed reviews; while it was a box office failure, it received a faithful following on DVD.</p><p>Further down the line in 2006, he featured in the Direct-to-DVD thriller, The Plague.&nbsp;This picture also got panned by the critics. Another memorable performance that surely brought in some Benjamins was the role he played on the hit TV series, How I Met Your Mother. He appeared in the 9th season of the show as the character Simon. That particular episode aired on November 25, 2013; it undoubtedly increased his visibility and equally increased his net worth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKRorK0edWapWaclad6o7HEpKpmppWperi70a2fZp2Rp7uqusasZJ%2Bqn6J6qbXSZqSorpmawG6tzZ1kra5dqLWww9JmaWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjames-van-der-beeks-net-worth-earnings-from-his-movies-and-tv-shows-2.html&text=James%20Van%20Der%20Beeks%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Earnings%20From%20His%20Movies%20And%20TV%20Shows&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjames-van-der-beeks-net-worth-earnings-from-his-movies-and-tv-shows-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjames-van-der-beeks-net-worth-earnings-from-his-movies-and-tv-shows-2.html&title=James%20Van%20Der%20Beeks%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Earnings%20From%20His%20Movies%20And%20TV%20Shows" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjames-van-der-beeks-net-worth-earnings-from-his-movies-and-tv-shows-2.html&title=James%20Van%20Der%20Beeks%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Earnings%20From%20His%20Movies%20And%20TV%20Shows" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjames-van-der-beeks-net-worth-earnings-from-his-movies-and-tv-shows-2.html&title=James%20Van%20Der%20Beeks%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Earnings%20From%20His%20Movies%20And%20TV%20Shows" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjames-van-der-beeks-net-worth-earnings-from-his-movies-and-tv-shows-2.html&description=James%20Van%20Der%20Beeks%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Earnings%20From%20His%20Movies%20And%20TV%20Shows" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jeffrey-soffers-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeffrey Soffers Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-deon-cole-married-to-wife-or-dating-a-girlfriend-kids-dylan-544577-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Deon Cole married to wife?
