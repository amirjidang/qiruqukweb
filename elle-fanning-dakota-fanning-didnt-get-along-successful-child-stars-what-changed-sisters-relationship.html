The following year, Dakota Fanning's career went to a whole new level when she landed roles in several major TV shows like ER, Spin City, Ally McBeal, and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.</p><p>After turning heads with her performances in those shows, Dakota Fanning landed one of the lead roles in a movie with Sean Penn.

Between the sisters, they worked with heavyweights like Denzel Washington, Tom Cruise, Eddie Murphy, Sean Penn, Jeff Bridges, and many more.</p><p>Since the Fanning sisters were so great in many movies, it is very safe to say that they both were talented actors as kids. With that in mind, it is safe to say that if they wanted to put up a front in public, the sisters were more than capable of playing their roles.</p><p>When Elle Fanning and Dakota Fanning appeared in public together as kids, they seemed extremely close. However, when Elle Fanning was interviewed by Porter in 2022, she revealed that she could be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the "worst" to her big sister</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kris Jenner’s Relationship With Her Mysterious Sister Is Not As Glamorous As The One She Has With Her Daughters</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I wasn’t getting recognized, but I was part of the madness.

During the resulting conversation, Dakota Fanning agreed that there was a time when she and her little sister didn't have much of a bond.</p><p>According to Dakota Fanning, there is a really simple reason why she and Elle Fanning didn't have much of a relationship for a while.
