Shows like <a href=#>The Bachelor</a> and Love is Blind are huge hits, and amazingly, there are plenty of couples that are <a href=#>able to make things work</a> out in the long run.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Marrying Millions featured couples with a massive wealth gap, and the show <a href=#>did produce some success stories</a> during its time on the air. Gentille and Brian were introduced during the show's inaugural season, and they were a genuinely fascinating pairing.</p><p>It's been some time, and fans want to know if these two are still together. We have all the details below!</p><h2 id=39-marrying-millions-39-was-a-wild-reality-show>'Marrying Millions' Was A Wild Reality Show</h2><p>For the unfamiliar, Marrying Millions is definitely one of the most interesting concepts on reality television. Instead of focusing on people trying to find love, this show was focused on couples who had a massive gap in wealth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Each couple had a completely different and unique backstory, but all of them had one thing in common: one person was filthy rich, and the other was not.</p><p>As you can imagine, a number of issues popped up for each couple. Personal issues, familial issues, and even issues within another person's friend group all made their presence felt during the show's run on television. It was always interesting to see how various people on the show reacted to each couple.</p><p>During the first season of the show, audiences were introduced to several notable couples. Among these notable couples was Brian and Gentille, a couple trying to make things work out in Las Vegas.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Temptation Island' Couples Still Together</a></span></p><h2 id=gentille-and-brian-were-together-in-season-one>Gentille And Brian Were Together In Season One</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brian and Gentille had wildly contrasting lifestyles that stretched beyond money. Gentille was a self-made baller, while Brian still lived with his parents. This was a great spin on things, as other couples featured men possessing the wealth. Despite their differences, Brian and Gentille struck up what seemed like a sold romance.</p><p>When talking about getting to know one another, Gentille opened up about what drew her to someone like Brian.</p><p>"He was just very humorous! He was very quirky and made me laugh a lot when I met him. I'm a very serious person for the most part, so for him being a goofball, it really lightened me up," she said.</p><p>Even though the pair seemed to have a great thing going, conflict was right around the corner. This especially reared its ugly head when Brian was forced to deal with Gentille's highly-judgmental friend group. Not only that, but Brian, who was adamant about tying the knot quickly, was discovered to have dated rich women previously.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cinemaholic</a>, "But just as Gentilleâ€™s friends had forewarned her, Brianâ€™s true intentions behind the urgency to marry her started to come to the surface. Gentilleâ€™s faith in him shook after learning from her close circle that her fiance was previously engaged to another wealthy woman. She was already having a hard time digesting that Brian was still living with his parents."</p><p>That is a lot for anyone to deal with, and it certainly played a hand in shaping the future of their relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are 'Big Brother' Stars Christmas Abbott And Memphis Garrett Still Together?</a></span></p><h2 id=are-they-still-together>Are They Still Together?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, were Gentille and Brian able to make things work out on the show, in spite of everything that had been brought up? No, no they weren't.</p><p>Instead of walking down the aisle to the altar, Gentille decided to pull the plug on everything.</p><p>When speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All About The Tea</a>, Gentille was open and honest about her feelings regarding Brian and his ability to father children, something that popped up on the show.</p><p>"He can barely function in society or take care of himself. I had to have this conversation to be able to know for sure and to make the correct decision to move forward through progression in life and our relationship," she said.</p><p>It was a surprising way to end the first season of the show, but you had better believe that Brian made a return on the show's second season.</p><p>Try as Brian may to get her back, Gentille was simply not hearing it. She thwarted his attempts to win back her heart, ultimately deciding to part ways with Brian forever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Uche And Clinton Of 'Are You The One' Still Together?
