There's something so deeply honest in the way he conducts himself, especially in an industry filled with false people. Because of the clarity of Craig's gentlemanly persona, the man has been able to get away with a lot. His jokes could be borderline offensive and he could make statements without being crucified in the press for it. Then there are <a href=#>all the times he shamelessly flirted with his female guests </a>on The Late Late Show when he hosted between 2005 - 2014. However, most of the women he was unabashedly affectionate with were his friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Craig is far from the Hollywood-type and doesn't spend a great deal of time with the rich and famous, he does have a few celebrity friends. Many of the people on this list were brought into Craig's life thanks to his late night show. Others he met when he was climbing up the ranks as a stand-up comedian and an actor. But each and every one of these icons (alive or dead) spent time with Craig when the cameras weren't rolling. Here's who has been part of Craig's inner circle...</p><h2 id=kristen-bell><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Kristen Bell</span></h2><p>Few actor celebrities have appeared on The Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson as many times as Kristen Bell. The two built a strong friendship after spending so much time together on the show and their bond has extended to their partners, Craig's wife Megan and Kristen's husband, Dax Shepard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gerard-butler><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Gerard Butler</span></h2><p>Craig and Gerard share a Scottish bond. The pair have spent a lot of time together on The Late Late Show and making the How To Train Your Dragon films. Because of all this, the two became "good buddies". Their chemistry is truly magnetic.</p><h2 id=drew-carey><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Drew Carey</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Carey! You're fired!" was Craig's catchphrase when he played the comedian's boss on The Drew Carey Show. This was the show that made Craig famous but it was also brought he and Drew together. Their friendship has lasted to this day and Drew was even asked to fill in for Craig on The Late Late Show when he had to take time off.</p><h2 id=stephen-fry><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Stephen Fry</span></h2><p>Craig adores actor, comedian, author, and acclaimed philosopher Stephen Fry so much that<a href=#> he changed his entire show just to interview him</a>. However, his hour-long sitdown with Stephen was far from the only time they spent together. Stephen and Craig actually knew each other when Craig was "a sad drunkard" climbing up the ranks as a comedian.</p><h2 id=peter-capaldi><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Peter Capaldi</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I've actually taken acid with my next guest," Craig said when he introduced The Doctor Who, Suicide Squad, and Thick Of It star, Peter Capaldi. The two actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">grew up in the same community in Scotland</a> and were even in a band together called "The Dreamboys", originally called "The Bast*rds from H*ll". They remained friends even as Craig got sober and they both became famous.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Craig Ferguson Really Left 'The Late Late Show'</a></span></p><h2 id=mila-kunis><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Mila Kunis</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mila quickly fell in with Craig after her first appearance on the show in 2009. She said it was the "best" talk show she'd ever done. Over the course of a few appearances, their chemistry developed. They really started to enjoy one another personally when Mila flew to Scotland to appear in Craig's week-long Scotland special.</p><h2 id=michael-clarke-duncan><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Michael Clarke Duncan</span></h2><p>The Green Mile actor, who passed away tragically in 2012, was a good friend of Craig's. In fact, Craig was one of the only people who could make fun of Michael and get away with it. The two spent a lot of time together on The Late Late Show and Michael even went to Scotland with Craig for his hometown shows. But so much of Craig's relationship with Michael was revealed during Craig's heartbreaking tribute to the Daredevil star after he passed. It's clear that Craig just adored him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kathie-lee-gifford><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Kathie Lee Gifford</span></h2><p>After Craig Ferguson co-hosted the Today Show with Kathie Lee for a week, the two became fast friends. They even decided to co-star in a movie called Then Came You. Their chemistry was so electric that Kathie had to tell USA that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there was nothing romantic going on between them</a>. During an interview on The Today Show, Craig stated, "We are great friends ... we kind of have nothing in common except that we adore each other and we're friends. I can't explain our friendship more than she can. But I think what it is, is if you genuinely adore someone, you just do."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eddie-izzard><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Eddie Izzard</span></h2><p>Eddie was a comedian that Craig respected long before the two became friends. But it was The Late Late Show that brought them together. Eddie appeared on the show a whopping 16 times and even traveled to France to join Craig for his Paris shows.</p><h2 id=rashida-jones><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Rashida Jones</span></h2><p>Rashida and Craig had a one-of-a-kind chemistry. Fans loved seeing it during her many appearances on the show, including her time in Scotland with Craig. The two became fast friends and clearly loved making each other laugh.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Some Fans Think The Job Of The Late-Night Host Died With Craig Ferguson</a></span></p><h2 id=billy-connolly><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Billy Connolly</span></h2><p>Like Gerard Butler, Craig and Billy share a bond because of their homeland of Scotland. But Craig has always looked up to Billy as a comedian. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he has stated that Billy is his "favorite" comedian</a> of all time. But the affection goes both ways as Billy has never shied away from praising Craig.</p><h2 id=maria-bello><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Maria Bello</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Craig has known Maria Bello for a long time, far before her first appearance on The Late Late Show. He even knows her kids. During one of their many interviews together, he even claimed that she was "a good friend".</p><h2 id=josh-robert-thompson><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Josh Robert Thompson</span></h2><p>Not only did Josh work with Craig for the years on The Late Late Show as the voice of his gay robot skeleton sidekick, Geoff Peterson, but he even became his opening act for his stand-up show. Craig and Josh's friendship developed as they bantered back-and-forth every night on the talk show but it's carried over into recent years. The pair just can't stop spending time together. They really are close friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth Behind Craig Ferguson's Gay Robot Skeleton Talk Show Sidekick</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robin-williams><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Robin Williams</span></h2><p>In an interview with QCOnline, Craig admitted that he developed an off-screen friendship with the late Robin Williams after his multiple appearances on the show. Few people could make Craig laugh as hard as Robin did. Following his tragic death, Craig stated that he was "sweet, generous and kind as well as a comedic genius".</p><h2 id=carrie-fisher><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Carrie Fisher</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like Robin Williams, Craig claims he actually built a personal friendship with the late <a href=#>Star Wars</a> actor thanks to her appearance on The Late Late Show. She even gifted him a pair of Kangaroo testicles which he kept on his desk throughout the run of his show. After her tragic death, Craig stated that she was "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the kindest and coolest</a> and most encouraging person [he] ever met in Hollywood" and said that he "adored her".</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Why Craig Ferguson Embarrassed A Member Of His Staff On National Television</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaq5mZnHqnsdGgrKynnmK2r7rEq2ScoaKYuaZ5xaugnqaUqHw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcraig-ferguson-inner-circle-friends.html&text=These%20Are%20The%20Celebs%20In%20Craig%20Ferguson%27s%20Inner%20Circle%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcraig-ferguson-inner-circle-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcraig-ferguson-inner-circle-friends.html&title=These%20Are%20The%20Celebs%20In%20Craig%20Ferguson%27s%20Inner%20Circle%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcraig-ferguson-inner-circle-friends.html&title=These%20Are%20The%20Celebs%20In%20Craig%20Ferguson%27s%20Inner%20Circle%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcraig-ferguson-inner-circle-friends.html&title=These%20Are%20The%20Celebs%20In%20Craig%20Ferguson%27s%20Inner%20Circle%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcraig-ferguson-inner-circle-friends.html&description=These%20Are%20The%20Celebs%20In%20Craig%20Ferguson%27s%20Inner%20Circle%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./war-machine-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="War Machine Net Worth  How Much Is War Machine Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hilary-duff-exhusband-mike-comrie-relationship-facts-divorce-co-parenting.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Truth About Hilary Duffs Ex-Husband Mike Comrie">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
