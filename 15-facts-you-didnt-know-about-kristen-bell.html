She had a huge cult following with Veronica Mars, and Forgetting Sarah Marshall gained some fans too, but she never quite reached that A-list level of fame.</p><p>Well, there’s no doubt about it.&nbsp;<a href=#>Kristen</a> is a huge star now. Her career is in its peak. Besides her ageless beauty, what set everything off was when Bell starred in Frozen. Even though the Disney blockbuster was animated, the buzz around its success put Bell on the map. She was interviewed and scrutinized, and every detail that arose made us like her even more.</p><p>You’ll be pleasantly surprised by many of the facts on this list. Don’t worry, there are some scandalous ones here too, but most of the time, you’ll be amazed by how intriguing, dorky, and refreshingly candid the gorgeous star can be.</p><h2 id=she-s-cross-eyed><strong>She’s Cross-Eyed</strong></h2><p>All right, we’re not sure if that’s the politically correct term. Some people refer to it as "lazy eye," and others use the scientific term strabismus. Kristen has called it her wonky eye and has said that it starts to turn in if she’s too tired or stressed out. The condition is quite common and is the result of weak eye muscles. There is a surgical procedure that treats the eye, but Bell has never opted to do that. Who needs surgery, right? That’s the attitude of most tough-as-nails mid-Westerners. Bell grew up in Michigan, in a suburb of Detroit.&nbsp;That is a pretty tough place to grow up in. When she was a kid, she played hockey in the street and broke both of her wrists. She still loves hockey and has been spotted at several games with her husband, <a href=#>Dax</a>. She says that growing up, Detroit Red Wings players were like "gods" to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-hates-koalas><strong>She Hates Koalas</strong></h2><p>A dietary choice which has become increasingly popular over the years is vegetarianism, which Bell has been practicing for years. There’s no doubt that the meat-free diet has eliminated much fat from her plate and helped her keep that banging figure. Besides being thin, another trait vegetarians usually share is their strong love for animals. Bell has been a spokesperson for PETA, and she and her husband were voted as Sexiest Vegetarian celebs of 2013. Bell happens to be obsessed with sloths. She thinks they are the coolest animal around and have some habits that she can relate to. Bell has said that she could sleep all day, if nobody woke her up. But don’t mistake a koala for a sloth. Oh, no, those are two different animals. When asked about the cuddly Australian marsupial, Bell was not pleased. “Koalas get high off eucalyptus and most of them have chlamydia. These are facts.”</p><h2 id=saved-olaf-s-entire-family><strong>Saved Olaf’s Entire Family</strong></h2><p>Kristen Bell was in Florida shooting a comedy,&nbsp;Like Father, when Hurricane Irma decided to devastate the area. Her co-star of Frozen&nbsp;and good buddy, Josh Gad, who voiced Olaf, had family in Miami. With all of the evacuations going on, you can imagine how difficult it was to find a hotel in safer parts of the state. Well, have no fear, Kristen Bell is here. She was staying in Orlando at a Disney Resort and invited Josh’s folks, brothers, sister-in-law, niece, and nephew to join her. Then she posted a selfie of her and Gad’s parents onto social media. Here is Olaf’s response on Instagram: “So @kristenanniebell literally saved my parents and my entire family tonight from #hurricaneirma… They don't make them like this girl. Thank you Kristin. You are truly an angel sent from above. And thank you @ewablueeyes for bother her when I asked you not to!!!!” That’s four exclamation points. All deserved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-wedding-singer><strong>The Wedding Singer</strong></h2><p>Every star has one of those stories about what they did before they got famous. And we know that Bell, aka Princess Anna, can sing, especially after holding her own with Queen Elsa, <a href=#>Idina Menzel</a>, in Frozen. So, it’s no surprise that the star used to sing at weddings, although that fact is still rather embarrassing. If you’re wondering what was on her playlist, that too is a little off. Kristen said she used to know every song by <a href=#>Harry Connick Jr</a>. What kind of wedding was she going to, anyway? I don’t think I’ve ever been to a wedding that played one Connick song, let alone an entire album’s worth. Luckily, the star didn’t have to suffer at the weddings for too long. She dropped out of college in her senior year when she landed a part on Broadway and played Becky Thatcher in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.</p><h2 id=hardcore-gamer><strong>Hardcore Gamer</strong></h2><p>People love playing video games. Even those of us who aren’t big fans have at least a couple of games that we can enjoy for an afternoon. Then, there are other people who could sit down and play for marathon sessions, until the game is beaten or they pass out from exhaustion. Bell is the latter, more serious type of gamer. She has even voiced several versions of Assassin’s Creed and Disney Infinity. She likes board games too. She and her husband, Dax Shepard, recently held a game contest. The winning couple will be flown out to their home in L.A. and play games with them for an evening, kind of like a cheesy double date. Kristen and Dax said that any game would do, but they preferred to play The Settlers of Catan. It also seems like the winning couple may want to purchase matching sweaters before heading to the airport. Kristen and Dax are so damn cute sometimes it is nauseating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=showing-it-all-in-photos><strong>Showing It All In Photos&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>We are repeatedly amazed at how candid this star can be. Bell has been quoted on just about every subject, and being a beautiful woman in Hollywood, she was surely asked about body image. And, of course, she rejects that perfection crap. She has said, “Who cares if there are lumps on my thighs? I'm guilty of having human legs made up of fat, muscle, and skin, and sometimes when you sit, they get bumpy!” We sure didn’t see any bumps when she posed in the buff for Allure magazine. She looked amazing wearing nothing but water and sand. Here’s an awesome quote taken from the Allure issue, “‘This is the first interview I've ever done where I'm not wearing panties. Lucky you,’ says Kristen Bell. And that is how I met the actress, who, for the record, was wearing a robe.”</p><h2 id=smurfette-attends-tisch-school-of-the-arts-in-new-york><strong>Smurfette&nbsp;Attends Tisch School of the Arts in New York</strong></h2><p>Growing up in Michigan, Kristen Bell was always a dramatic kid. Her mom even got her an agent when she was 13, and she landed commercial jobs and modeling gigs for Detroit businesses. She also did high school plays and won recognition for lead roles in The Wizard of Oz and Lil Abner. She was even voted “Prettiest Girl in School” in the high school yearbook. The dramatic success encouraged her to attend Tisch School of the Arts in New York, where she eventually found roles on Broadway. But if you know anything about kids who like drama, then you know that there might be some weird tendencies there. When Kristen was young, she insisted that her family called her Smurfette. When that got old, she made them call her Matthew. Then after that, she went with Annie, which is her middle name. Can’t blame her for not liking Kristen, though. She must have gotten Christine or Kirsten all the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-delivered-babies><strong>She Delivered Babies</strong></h2><p>We know Kristen is a mom. She has two kids, both daughters, named Lincoln and Delta. But we’re not talking about giving birth here. What kind of crappy list would include a well-known fact like that? What we’re talking about here is the delivering of babies. Like what the OB-GYN doctor does, as in reaching down there and literally pulling a child out of a woman. How many Hollywood actors can say they’ve done that? At one point in her life, Bell did some volunteer work down in Brazil where the births took place. She helped bring two babies into the world. That’s pretty bad-a*s. Another random bad-a*s fact is that the girl has a motorcycle license. So watch out, we've got a wild child here. Unpredictable.</p><h2 id=tweeted-her-wedding-proposal><strong>Tweeted Her Wedding Proposal</strong></h2><p>We have already mentioned that Kristen is married to Dax Shepard, the actor who starred in lots of stuff, like Parenthood&nbsp;and CHIPs, the movie. He got his start on <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a>’s Punk’d, which pranked celebs with hidden cameras. Dax and Bell had been dating for a while, but according to Bell, she was in love after the first month. Meanwhile, Dax needed some more time. They were dating other people at first, and Dax even blew Kristen off a couple times. So Bell upped the ante and got serious. She actually proposed to Dax on Twitter, and he accepted. The couple didn’t have a huge wedding ceremony. Bell said that she was used to getting enough attention already, due to her acting career. They married at the local courthouse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=struck-by-dinklage><strong>Struck By Dinklage</strong></h2><p>Stars are fans too. They’re people who have heroes and idols in the entertainment business, just like normal people. Kristen has worked with some big stars over the years. In her latest sitcom, The Good Place, she works alongside TV legend <a href=#>Ted Danson</a>. In Bad Moms&nbsp;and Bad Moms Christmas, she worked with A-listers like <a href=#>Mila Kunis</a>. She’s had love scenes with critically-acclaimed actors like <a href=#>Greg Kinnear</a> and <a href=#>Don Cheadle</a>. Just imagine all of the famous celebrities she has run into over the years at red carpet interviews and awards shows. But Kristen claims to have been starstruck by only one star in particular,&nbsp;<a href=#>Peter Dinklage</a>&nbsp;from Game Of Thrones. Bell is obviously a GoT fan and was speechless upon meeting Tyrion Lannister.</p><h2 id=dessert-lover><strong>Dessert&nbsp;Lover</strong></h2><p>Like most humans, especially in the high-stress atmosphere of show business, people tend to find a substance they can lean on. So what exactly is Bell’s vice of choice? Well, this may surprise some of you, but the super-safe vice of this beautiful blonde is dessert. Yes, Bell eats dessert after every meal. And she somehow manages to keep a great figure at the same time. She is often seen jogging around LA, which helps shed the sugar weight. She’s also a fan of yoga and does poses in random places around the house. She says she constantly works out, like doing squats in the living room, while playing with her two daughters. She touts community outreach as her therapy, which has helped her avoid the temptation of alcohol. Dax, her husband, has a much darker past, which he does not try to hide. He is now 13 years sober and speaks candidly about his past, in order to help those who currently struggle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=avoids-her-kids><strong>Avoids Her Kids</strong></h2><p>Bell keeps it real. That’s one of the things we love about her. If you ask her a question, it’s guaranteed that she will hit you with an honest answer, which is usually pretty funny too. Put her in a movie, like the Bad Moms series, and those questions naturally point to motherhood. And Kristen admits that, yes, her kids drive her nuts. She has to have time alone or she realizes that she will lose her mind. She says, "Every day when you're raising kids, you feel like you could cry or crack up and just scream 'This is ridiculous!' because there's so much nonsense, whether it's what they're saying to you or the fact that there's avocado or poop on every surface." Yes, that would drive anybody nuts... especially the poop.</p><h2 id=dated-the-glee-dude><strong>Dated The "Glee" Dude</strong></h2><p>Remember the Glee dude? He was the curly-haired teacher who burst spontaneously into song every now and then. And not just any song, but one with crazy lighting, harmonization, and expert choreography. Yes, the whole musical idea was a corny one, but the show worked somehow and launched the careers of <a href=#>Lea Michele</a>, <a href=#>Chris Colfer</a>, and relaunched&nbsp;<a href=#>Jane Lynch</a>'s. <a href=#>Matthew Morrison</a> was the actor who played Mr. Will Schuester, and his career hasn’t done that well since. He did, however, date Kristen Bell once. The couple met in New York and dated way back in 1995 before Glee&nbsp;came about. Another one of Bell’s exes is Kevin Mann, a producer who backed&nbsp;Fanboys, a film in which Bell starred. This relationship was much more serious, and the couple was engaged. Bell broke off the engagement and was spotted with Dax weeks later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=not-afraid-of-scandalous-scenes><strong>Not Afraid Of&nbsp;Scandalous Scenes</strong></h2><p>After reading this article, you kind of get the feeling that Bell is a bit of a goody-two-shoes. She’s sweet and funny and doesn’t party a ton like most Hollywood types. But there’s a really hot side to Bell as well, and that’s yet another thing to love. It’s a well-known fact that Bell is very at ease with her body. She has been known to walk around the house in the buff. She says being bare is the most comfortable way to be. She jokes that she has to make sure the gardener isn’t coming to the house that day, and then her clothes hit the floor. She has also been in several steamy scenes. Like we mentioned earlier, she did it with Greg Kinnear and Don Cheadle in Stuck in Love and House of Lies, respectively. And Forgetting Sarah Marshall had some great scenes too. But her most scandalous scene was in The Lifeguard. She later said her co-star, David Lambert, “Was game for us to get as intimate as possible.” We bet he was.</p><h2 id=got-caught-doing-it><strong>Got Caught Doing It</strong></h2><p>Here’s a story that broke just recently in the wake of promoting the Bad Moms Christmas movie, which is in theaters now. Like we’ve mentioned before, Kristen has an uncanny habit of saying the funniest and most random things. Well, when she showed up on The Talk, those ladies set her up with some potentially embarrassing questions. But they couldn’t make Bell blush, and she answered with brutal honesty that floored everybody in the room. “Oh, [the kids] walked in on us having s-.” she said, “Well, we didn’t, like, continue… we sort of just went like, ‘Hey, what’s up? What do you need? What do you need?’… And then we just said, ‘Mommy and daddy are just going to take a nap for a couple of minutes.'” Dax and Belle have admitted to participating in marriage counselling, but power naps like that are surely the best therapy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: People, IMDb, Bustle, Wikipedia, ENews, BoomsBeat</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2brqTA0mawqK1dmbalutNmoqenp2Kuo7vUrWSkqpmowaa6jJucpaRf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-facts-you-didnt-know-about-kristen-bell.html&text=15%20Facts%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20About%20Kristen%20Bell&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-facts-you-didnt-know-about-kristen-bell.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-facts-you-didnt-know-about-kristen-bell.html&title=15%20Facts%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20About%20Kristen%20Bell" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-facts-you-didnt-know-about-kristen-bell.html&title=15%20Facts%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20About%20Kristen%20Bell" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-facts-you-didnt-know-about-kristen-bell.html&title=15%20Facts%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20About%20Kristen%20Bell" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-facts-you-didnt-know-about-kristen-bell.html&description=15%20Facts%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20About%20Kristen%20Bell" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-surprising-facts-about-dwayne-johnson-that-even-fans-cant-ignore.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Surprising Facts About Dwayne Johnson That Even Fans Can't Ignore">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rihannas-rents-mansion-80k-month.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="You Can Rent Out Rihanna's Mansion...
