She is believed to weigh 54 kg (199 lbs). While she has a small figure, she has been able to build muscle that makes her appear slightly bigger than is typical for someone of her size.</strong></p><p>Rubi has been in the spotlight for a while now and this has garnered some interest in her body measurements. Asides from her budding musical and modeling career, the American rapper is known for her high-profile relationships. Even though she is currently single, she has in the past dated people like Cam Newton, Soulja Boy, DDG, Lil Tjay, Travis Scott, and Playboi Carti amongst others.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=rubi-rose-bio-summary></span><strong>Rubi Rose Bio Summary</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Rubi Rose’s Age:</strong> 25 years old</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 2nd of October 1997</li><li><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Lexington, Kentucky, United States</li><li><strong>Birth Sign:</strong> Libra</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Black African, African American, and Caucasian</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Height:</strong> 5 feet 4 inches or 163 cm or 1.63 m</li><li><strong>Weight:</strong> 59 kg or 114 lbs</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rubi-roses-height-is-average></span><strong>Rubi Rose’s Height is Average</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rubi Rose is an African American rapper whose career in music is still budding. The average American woman is believed to stand at a height of 5 feet 4 inches and this is exactly Rubi Rose’s height. She falls right in the average height distribution for an American woman.</p><p>Conversely, in the same country where the average height for male people is put at 5 feet 9 inches, Rubi Rose falls a few inches to the short category of the overall population. Regardless of this, her height has played no part in the success she enjoys right now.<br>The physique that she has, has played a role in the number of relationships that she has had since she became very popular.</p><p>The rapper is believed to have had relationships with a number of men who also work in entertainment, particularly rappers. Her first known boyfriend is Cam Newton and the two were together in 2017. Within that same time, she was in an off-and-on relationship with Lil Yachty which lasted from 2016 up until 2017. Playboi Carti and Travis Scott are two other people she dated and her most recent relationship was with DDG – they dated for just a year in 2020 and it ended in 2021.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rubi-roses-height-compared-to-the-height-of-other-female-rappers></span><strong>Rubi Rose’s Height Compared to the Height of Other Female Rappers</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>For other female rappers like Rubi Rose, height distribution is pretty much the same for these up-and-coming rappers.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=rubi-roses-height-vs-cuban-dolls></span><strong>Rubi Rose’s Height vs Cuban Doll’s</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The Bankrupt crooner, Cuban Doll is only 5 feet 2 inches which places her just two inches below Rubi Rose.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-rubi-rose-compared-to-saweetie></span><strong>How Tall is Rubi Rose Compared to Saweetie?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Saweetie, who is known for her hit songs like “My Type,” “Best Friend,” and “Tap In,” is taller than Rubi Rose. She stands at 5 feet 6 inches tall which places Rubi two inches below her.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=rubi-roses-height-compared-to-sukihanas-height></span><strong>Rubi Rose’s Height Compared To Sukihana’s Height</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Sukihana, unlike Rubi Rose, is a Reality TV star who also works as a rapper and just like Rubi Rose, was also in Cardi B’s WAP music video. She came to fame after being on the show Love and HipHop. However, she is 5 feet 1 inch tall, making Rubi Rose three inches taller than her.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=rubi-roses-height-vs-lattos></span><strong>Rubi Rose’s Height vs Latto’s</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Latto is another American rapper who is still making a name for herself in the music industry just like Rubi Rose. Latto also happens to be taller than Rubi, as she is 5 feet 5 inches tall, compared to Rose’s 5 feet 4 inches. Her name Latto is a reference to her mixed ethnicity.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-rubi-rose-on-a-diet></span><strong>Is Rubi Rose on a Diet?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There is no confirmed information about Rubi Rose being on a diet and this is something she has never spoken about. However, it is not unlikely that she gets this question a lot. From her pictures, it would seem like she has almost no body fat, but from these same pictures, particularly the ones on her Instagram, she is often out in restaurants having a great time with food and her friends.</p><p>Regardless of all of this, there remains no information on what her eating patterns are or if she is on a diet. There is however nothing to suggest that the rapper is on a diet. The way she looks can be credited to genetic conditions or being a result of time spent in the gym.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-rubi-roses-weight></span><strong>What is Rubi Rose’s Weight?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rubi Rose is believed to weigh somewhere around 59 kg or 199 lbs. Her other body measurements include:</p><ul><li>Breast – 36 inches (91 cm)</li><li>Waist – 24 inches (61 cm)</li><li>Hips – 40 inches (102)</li></ul><p>Also, she has brown hair and brown eyes, and a small physique all of these features combined make her a very beautiful woman who used her looks to start her career.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-curvy-is-the-american-rapper></span><strong>How Curvy is the American Rapper?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>From the stance that Rubi takes when taking pictures, it’s safe to presume that her curvaceous “booty” is one of her most prized body assets. She uses every opportunity to show off her curvy behind which has contributed to drawing attention to her and her career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqll7Zuvs6snGaglZ60qcCMsJyin5ipeqK6w2aZqJypYrqmrdKuqZ6llaPBtHnRnq2emZyasXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frubi-rose-height-weight-and-body-measurements-revealed.html&text=Rubi%20Rose%20Height%2c%20Weight%20and%20Body%20Measurements%20Revealed&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frubi-rose-height-weight-and-body-measurements-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frubi-rose-height-weight-and-body-measurements-revealed.html&title=Rubi%20Rose%20Height%2c%20Weight%20and%20Body%20Measurements%20Revealed" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frubi-rose-height-weight-and-body-measurements-revealed.html&title=Rubi%20Rose%20Height%2c%20Weight%20and%20Body%20Measurements%20Revealed" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frubi-rose-height-weight-and-body-measurements-revealed.html&title=Rubi%20Rose%20Height%2c%20Weight%20and%20Body%20Measurements%20Revealed" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frubi-rose-height-weight-and-body-measurements-revealed.html&description=Rubi%20Rose%20Height%2c%20Weight%20and%20Body%20Measurements%20Revealed" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./scandal-season-4-episode-3-recap-biggest-moments-from-inside-the-bub-20141010.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Scandal Season 4 Episode 3 Recap: Biggest Moments from &amp;quot;Inside the Bub">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rick-kirkham.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rick Kirkham Wiki, Age, Wife, Net worth, Biography, Family &amp;amp; Facts">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
