She started modeling at a young age and is already one of the world's biggest supermodels at 19 years old. She does share two dads, Seal, and Flavio Briatore.</p><p>Seal is a man that needs little introduction. He is a legendary musician who has recorded tons of hit songs, such as "Kiss From A Rose".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/leni-klum-red-carpet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Page Six</a>, Seal was married to Heidi when Leni was born. He quickly stepped up to become a father figure to her. Seal adopted Leni when she was five years old and raised her as his own daughter alongside his biological children with Heidi.</p><p>However, <a href=#>after Seal and Heidi's nasty divorce in 2014</a>, he reportedly had limited contact with Leni due to tensions between him and Heidi, as well as Briatore.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Heidi Klum's Relationship With Her Bodyguard Might've Been The Reason Why She Divorced Seal</a></span></p><p>Who exactly is Briatore?</p><p>Well, he is a well-known Italian businessman. According to Bleacher Report, he is best known for his involvement in the Formula One racing industry.</p><p>Born in 1950 in Italy where he was also raised, Briatore started his career as a restaurant manager before moving into the fashion industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to TMZ, in the 1980s and 1990s, Briatore became involved in the fashion industry and was instrumental in launching several successful clothing brands such as Benetton and Billionaire. He also ventured into music management and was responsible for managing several popular artists.</p><p>However, it was his involvement in Formula One that brought him international fame. In 1988, he became a team manager for Benetton Formula Ltd., where he played a key role in helping Michael Schumacher win two World Championships.</p><p>Briatore's career has not been without controversy. Per ESPN, in 2008 he was banned from all FIA-sanctioned events after being found guilty of race-fixing allegations during the Singapore Grand Prix. However, this ban was later overturned by a French court.</p><p>Despite all of these things, Briatore is a father first and foremost. He is the biological father of Leni, despite all the drama that has followed him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Untitled-design---2022-05-04T131341476.jpg><p>While there have been rumors of tension between Seal and Briatore over their respective roles in Leni's life, both men have made efforts to be present for their daughter. In fact, Seal has spoken publicly about his love for Leni on several occasions despite their limited contact over the years. Similarly, Briatore has been seen spending time with Leni on various occasions throughout her childhood.</p><h2 id=do-seal-and-flavio-briatore-get-along-or-do-they-have-beef-with-each-other>Do Seal And Flavio Briatore Get Along Or Do They Have Beef With Each Other?</h2><p>The relationship between Seal and Briatore, both fathers to Leni Klum, has been a subject of speculation for years. While many believe that the two fathers get along well, there have been reports of conflict and misunderstandings between them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One possible source of conflict is the fact that Briatore is a wealthy businessman with connections to the fashion industry. Seal is extremely wealthy too, <a href=#>with a net worth of $40 million</a>, but he gets his earning from his Grammy-winning singing and songwriting. It may not seem like much, but the backgrounds between the two can make for something of a culture shock when it comes to raising Leni.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Seal-featured-image.jpg><p>That leads to another source of tension, their differing parenting styles. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Wonderwall</a>, Seal has spoken openly about his desire to be an active and involved father. Meanwhile, Briatore has been criticized for his absenteeism. He has been there for Leni, but not nearly to the extent of Seal's participation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite these potential sources of conflict, there are also indications that Seal and Briatore have managed to build a positive relationship for the sake of their daughter. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Seal spoke highly of Briatore and expressed gratitude for the role he plays in Leni's life. They have both been seen attending events together and spending time with Leni as a family unit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/leni-klum-has-two-very-different-dads-but-do-seal-and-flavio-briatore-actually-get-along_.jpg><p>In Leni's case, having two very different dads could be challenging for her if they did not get along or work together as co-parents. However, it seems that Seal and Briatore have found a way to put aside any differences they may have had in the past and prioritize Leni's best interests. This type of cooperation between parents is essential for creating a stable environment for their shared child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition, effective co-parenting can help mitigate any negative effects that may arise from divorce or separation on the child. When children are exposed to conflict between their parents, it can lead to emotional distress or behavioral problems down the line.</p><p>Co-parenting allows children to maintain healthy relationships with both parents even after a separation, which can help them feel more secure and stable. Some argue that successful co-parenting can prevent children from going down darker paths when they grow up.</p><p>Heidi's relationship with Leni has been a topic of discussion due to the close bond they share and is also important when examining Seal and Briatore's relationship. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The mother-daughter duo often appear together on red carpets and social media posts</a>, showcasing their strong connection.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Johan Riley Fyodor Taiwo Samuel Close With His Dad, Seal?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Heidi has also spoken about how important it is for her to be present in her children's lives and how she prioritizes spending time with them.</p><p>Despite challenges such as divorce and co-parenting arrangements, Leni's parents have remained dedicated to raising and protecting their shared daughter. So has Briatore and Seal, <a href=#>despite the latter's re-commitment to music</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijnqaZYritwcxmmaKnnKS0qq%2FApWSfmaSdsrN5xaWYr6GfYq%2BztcCtpqudXaiyoriMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fleni-klum-biological-father-flavio-briatore-seal-relationship.html&text=Leni%20Klum%20Has%20Two%20Very%20Different%20Dads%2c%20But%20Do%20Seal%20And%20Flavio%20Briatore%20Actually%20Get%20Along%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fleni-klum-biological-father-flavio-briatore-seal-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fleni-klum-biological-father-flavio-briatore-seal-relationship.html&title=Leni%20Klum%20Has%20Two%20Very%20Different%20Dads%2c%20But%20Do%20Seal%20And%20Flavio%20Briatore%20Actually%20Get%20Along%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fleni-klum-biological-father-flavio-briatore-seal-relationship.html&title=Leni%20Klum%20Has%20Two%20Very%20Different%20Dads%2c%20But%20Do%20Seal%20And%20Flavio%20Briatore%20Actually%20Get%20Along%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fleni-klum-biological-father-flavio-briatore-seal-relationship.html&title=Leni%20Klum%20Has%20Two%20Very%20Different%20Dads%2c%20But%20Do%20Seal%20And%20Flavio%20Briatore%20Actually%20Get%20Along%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fleni-klum-biological-father-flavio-briatore-seal-relationship.html&description=Leni%20Klum%20Has%20Two%20Very%20Different%20Dads%2c%20But%20Do%20Seal%20And%20Flavio%20Briatore%20Actually%20Get%20Along%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lex-fridman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lex Fridman Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lana-parrilla-husband-who-is-lana-parrilla-married-to-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lana Parrilla Husband: Who Is Lana Parrilla Married To Now?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
