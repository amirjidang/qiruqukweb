However, questions still abound, especially since coworkers and celebrities had plenty of both up-front and low-key comments to make. Schneider, <a href=#>who made millions with Nickelodeon</a> before his departure in 2018, is probably the channel's most successful producer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Amanda Show, Zoey 101, Drake & Josh, iCarly, Victorious, and Sam & Cat are among Schneider's famous shows. Most of his creations are a part of '90s kids' childhoods, so he's a big deal. Also, he played a role in the success of some of today's stars like Amanda Bynes, Jamie Lynn Spears, Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Victoria Justice, and Ariana Grande.</p><p>Given the success of his teen sitcoms, plus the popularity that followed some upcoming stars, it was a shocker when allegations about his behavior and impropriety surfaced. Add the fact that he was working with minors, so rumors overflowed, and the public wanted to know more.</p><p><strong>Updated August 28, 2022: </strong>This article has been updated to reflect new Nickelodeon news related to Dan Schneider and Jennette McCurdy's recent accomplishments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=critics-say-dan-schneider-had-a-weird-focus-on-feet>Critics Say Dan Schneider Had A Weird Focus On Feet</h2><p>When watching Schneider's shows, all viewers see on the screen are seemingly innocent and harmless, especially since kids and teens are the target audience. However, in the mid-2010s, public scrutiny of his creations became harsh.</p><p>Some critics say the shows involving minors are packed with inappropriate innuendos, going as far as to say that <a href=#>the producer got away with some unsavory things</a> during his time working with kids.</p><p>For instance, on iCarly, conspiracy theorists had a field day scouring for old clips of feet-related scenes. There's a scene where Sam Puckett (McCurdy) is sleeping, and her feet are tickled by Carly (Cosgrove). In another, Carly is getting a foot massage from Gibby (Noah Munck).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Sam & Cat, there's also a moment of foot massage, and a scene where Sam has to use a remote control with her feet. It doesn't end there because one of the most notorious feet-focused scenes under Schneider's watch involved Ariana in Victorious.</p><p>The show was accused of sexualizing the actress, who played the role of Cat Valentine, during a scene where she was in bed putting her toes into her mouth. There's also that potato scene with Cat, which was criticized as a form of infantilization.</p><p>There were also instances of Schneider tweeting about feet and the Sam & Cat Twitter account asking for feet photos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Forgotten Facts About The Dan Schneider Scandal</a></span></p><p>Aside from the supposed foot fetish and sexualization, there were reports of Schneider's temper issues, abusive behavior against the staff, excessive production budgets, long shooting days, and a toxic work environment with him.</p><h2 id=when-did-jennette-mccurdy-work-with-dan-schneider>When Did Jennette McCurdy Work With Dan Schneider?</h2><p>Jennete McCurdy has been one of the most vocal about her horrible experiences during her acting stint on Nick. The actress was generous in sharing her thoughts about her run with iCarly and Sam & Cat, saying she's embarrassed by her past roles and that Nickelodeon caused her to leave acting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She starred in the said shows for more than five years, dealing with workplace stress and pressure from her mother at an early age. She said even though she was not interested in acting, she continued doing it to support her family. "I feel so unfulfilled by the roles that I played," she said in one of the episodes of her podcast, Empty Inside.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Were Miranda Cosgrove And Jennette McCurdy Involved In The Dan Schneider Scandal?</a></span></p><p>She has no plans to return to acting and, since 2017, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has seemed to be focused on writing and directing</a>. Aside from the podcast, she also started her music career; worked with Netflix for a starring role in Between; created the one-woman show I'm Glad My Mom Died; and directed The McCurdys, Kenny, The Grave, and Strong Independent Women.</p><p>Jennette's recently published book, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a memoir titled I'm Glad My Mom Died</a>, hit the NY Times BestSellers list and sold out on Amazon in one day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-jennette-mccurdy-said-about-dan-schneider>What Has Jennette McCurdy Said About Dan Schneider?</h2><p>McCurdy is not part of the iCarly reboot, not surprising given her previous statements of being ashamed of her role in the original show. It can be remembered that in 2013, she shared a Vine video addressed to Schneider, which some say was a cry for help.</p><p>McCurdy ended that post with, "Look what you've done to me."</p><p>In 2014, in what others think as a rebuke, she and Cosgrove did not attend the 2014 Kids' Choice Awards when Schneider was the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2019, she also opened up about her eating disorder which started when she was 11.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Former Nickelodeon Producer Dan Schneider Claims Comedy With Feet Didn't Cross The Line</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There were no direct statements about Schneider's role in any of the issues, so fans continue to speculate.</p><h2 id=what-does-dan-schneider-say-about-the-allegations>What Does Dan Schneider Say About The Allegations?</h2><p>After leaving Nickelodeon, Schneider stayed away from the limelight until 2021, when he decided to return to producing. In an interview with Deadline, he said there was no misconduct during his stay at Nick, saying allegations of foot fetish and improper behavior are "ridiculous."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He insisted his comedy was "innocent,</a>" and that social media just exaggerated everything.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though there were no direct accusations against him about being inappropriate with the young stars, the issue never died down because of a seeming lack of formal statements. For instance, when Nick and Schneider separated, the reason mentioned was pursuing "other opportunities and projects." No comments were coming from his coworkers and the celebrities.</p><p>A New York Times story said there was no evidence of sexual misconduct by Schneider and referenced a ViacomCBS investigation that indicated the same. Even so, the supposed lack of transparency resulted in conspiracy theories that continue to this day, especially since iCarly is back.</p><p>There have also been new accounts of misconduct alleged by former Nickelodeon stars; former Zoey 101 actress <a href=#>Alexa Nikolas called Schneider the "creator of childhood trauma.</a>" This occurred while Alexa was protesting Nickelodeon in front of its headquarters in August 2022. Jennette does not appear to have commented on Alexa's allegations or her protest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYremus2eq62dXaKwpMHRnbBmq5GesW6twaisrWWUlrtuv8KhpZ6hlJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-jennette-mccurdy-said-about-dan-schneider.html&text=What%20Has%20Jennette%20McCurdy%20Said%20About%20Dan%20Schneider%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-jennette-mccurdy-said-about-dan-schneider.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-jennette-mccurdy-said-about-dan-schneider.html&title=What%20Has%20Jennette%20McCurdy%20Said%20About%20Dan%20Schneider%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-jennette-mccurdy-said-about-dan-schneider.html&title=What%20Has%20Jennette%20McCurdy%20Said%20About%20Dan%20Schneider%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-jennette-mccurdy-said-about-dan-schneider.html&title=What%20Has%20Jennette%20McCurdy%20Said%20About%20Dan%20Schneider%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-jennette-mccurdy-said-about-dan-schneider.html&description=What%20Has%20Jennette%20McCurdy%20Said%20About%20Dan%20Schneider%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-kumalala-vs-savesta-guy-meme-new-manga-trend-takes-over-on-tiktok-312456-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Kumalala vs Savesta Guy Meme?
