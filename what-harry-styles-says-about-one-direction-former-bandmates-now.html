And fans were delighted to hear that the British singer still holds his former bandmates in high regard.</p><h2 id=does-harry-styles-have-ldquo-deep-love-rdquo-for-the-one-direction-boys>Does Harry Styles Have “Deep Love” For The One Direction Boys?</h2><p>In his interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry shared that he couldn’t imagine achieving the global stardom he did with One Direction as a solo artist</a> without the other boys there to provide support and companionship.</p><p>“I feel really lucky that we always, like, had each other to be this unit that felt like you could keep each other in check,” Harry explained. “You know, just like have someone else who gets it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Lorde Is Dying To Collaborate With This One Direction Band Member</a></span></p><p>Harry opened up about never feeling like he was alone on one side “of the glass” looking at the rest of the world who didn’t really get [what it was like to be in One Direction] because the other boys were there with him going through the same experiences.</p><p>When Zane asked Harry if the One Direction boys still share “a bond that can’t be broken”, Harry said, “I think there’s very much like a respect between all of us, of like, we did something together, and that is something that you can’t really undo, and it’s like a very deep love for each other, I think.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-one-direction-made-it-hard-for-harry-to-make-the-music-he-wanted>How One Direction Made It Hard For Harry To Make The Music He Wanted</h2><p>In an interview with Better Homes and Gardens, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry revealed how his approach to making music has changed since leaving One Direction</a>. He was hesitant about making “fun” music in the days after the band, when he first stepped out as a solo artist.</p><p>"I'd come out of the band, and it was like, if I want to be taken seriously as a musician, then I can't make fun music," he said, likening the experience to "bowling with the bumpers up, playing it safe.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Career Path Harry Styles Almost Pursued Before One Direction</a></span></p><p>However, Harry has since changed his perspective and become more comfortable with himself as a solo artist, no longer feeling like he has anything to prove to the world.</p><p>“I just want to make stuff that is right, that is fun, in terms of the process, that I can be proud of for a long time, that my friends can be proud of, that my family can be proud of, that my kids will be proud of one day,” he said, in reference to his latest album Harry’s House.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Finally, it doesn't feel like my life is over if this album isn't a commercial success.”</p><p>The singer also opened up about how <a href=#>being in One Direction led to a massive invasion of his privacy.</a></p><h2 id=where-do-the-other-one-direction-boys-stand>Where Do The Other One Direction Boys Stand?</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">other boys from One Direction have also spoken positively about Harry</a> to the press, so it seems that he’s on the money with claims that they still harbor a mutual love for each other.</p><p>“In a band, you’re going to get some people who get on really well and some people who get on quite well,” Louis Tomlinson said in an interview with The Sun, “I have forever had a very, very high level of respect for Harry.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Things One Direction Members Have Been Up To Since Their Split</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, Niall revealed that he was excited to support Harry when he was nominated for a Brit Award: “I was in rehearsals and they said do you want to present an award? I was like well the boys are up for awards, you know Harry and Lewis [Capaldi], so I’ll come for a bit of moral support.”</p><p>Liam Payne has recently made headlines with claims that Simon Cowell originally packaged One Direction around his face “and worked around the rest”, and that he was the one to “lead the band” on the original X-Factor stage. Liam also asserted that he had “the most successful first solo single” of the band members.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While some fans have interpreted this as anti-Harry talk, including Lizzo, who rushed to Harry’s defense on TikTok, Liam has otherwise publicly supported Harry and spoken of his fondness for his former bandmate.</p><p>“Congrats [Harry] on your Grammy win,” Liam wrote on Instagram after Harry had won his first Grammy Award in 2021. “What a huge moment, proud to be your brother.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Which Members Of One Direction Are Still In Regular Contact</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivtGyZKysqaGytHnSmrCsZZGXvLbAjKilnmWUnr%2Bmr9OipqdllqS%2FrrHRZpmappSirrWx0malqK9f</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-harry-styles-says-about-one-direction-former-bandmates-now.html&text=How%20Does%20Harry%20Styles%20Feel%20About%20His%20Former%20One%20Direction%20Bandmates%20Now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-harry-styles-says-about-one-direction-former-bandmates-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-harry-styles-says-about-one-direction-former-bandmates-now.html&title=How%20Does%20Harry%20Styles%20Feel%20About%20His%20Former%20One%20Direction%20Bandmates%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-harry-styles-says-about-one-direction-former-bandmates-now.html&title=How%20Does%20Harry%20Styles%20Feel%20About%20His%20Former%20One%20Direction%20Bandmates%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-harry-styles-says-about-one-direction-former-bandmates-now.html&title=How%20Does%20Harry%20Styles%20Feel%20About%20His%20Former%20One%20Direction%20Bandmates%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-harry-styles-says-about-one-direction-former-bandmates-now.html&description=How%20Does%20Harry%20Styles%20Feel%20About%20His%20Former%20One%20Direction%20Bandmates%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-jeffrey-epstein-made-his-577-million-fortune.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Jeffrey Epstein Made His $577 Million Fortune">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hayden-christensen-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-47261-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hayden Christensen Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
