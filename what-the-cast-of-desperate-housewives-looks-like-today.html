It was an addictive show because just like Fifty Shades of Grey, it was a scandalous outlet for all the fantasies that stay-at-home moms have. Just admit it; it’s true! It wasn’t long before people all over the world were tuning into the show to see what scandalous deeds these women got into while their husbands were at work. There were affairs and intrigue throughout the seasons that always kept us wanting more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most women could only dream of living in luxury while being stay-at-home moms. But there’s also the other side of the coin where boredom can kick in, and that’s when these scandalous ladies would always get themselves into trouble. The show was popular because it always had juicy storylines and complex characters whom you could really sink your teeth into, which is probably why it lasted a whopping eight seasons before it ended. Now that the show has come and gone, it’s time to take a look back at our favorite actors and where they went after the show. We’ve all wondered what they look like now. You may be shocked because not all of them look the same as they once did. If you're dying to know what happened to those stars, then tune in. This is the cast of Desperate Housewives, then and now!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicollette-sheridan><strong>Nicollette Sheridan</strong></h2><p>It seems as if these women have some fountain of youth elixir that we’re not aware of. Considering thirteen years has gone by, these women are aging quite gracefully. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicollette Sheridan</a> hasn’t done a whole lot since the end of Desperate Housewives. Her career has calmed down quite a bit. Whether that was a conscious choice or not is hard to say. She certainly hasn’t been in anything big or popular since then. For the most part, her career has consisted of making TV movies such as Jewtopia, Let’s Kill Ward’s Wife, The Christmas Spirit, and All Yours. “I'm actually more comfortable playing the stroke victim or the girl with no makeup on, looking scruffy, and it's all about what's going on inside rather than on the outside.” She's always looked polished, so we’re not sure if we're buying this one or not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vanessa-williams><strong>Vanessa Williams</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanessa William</a>s has had a solid career since the ending of Desperate Housewives; she's been in multiple TV shows since. She still looks amazing, so the past decade has certainly been kind to her. Since the show, Williams has hopped from one TV show to the next. She went on to star in roles on shows such as Daytime Divas, The Librarians, The Good Wife, Milo Murphy’s Law, 666 Park Avenue, and Broad City. She's been busy over the years and doesn’t seem to have any interest in slowing down. She’s managed to juggle that schedule with a family as well, but that's something you just get used to. “I think there's a time to work, and everyone has to kind of adjust. And then there's a time to relax, and be the mom or take the kids on vacation when you need to wind down. So it's a matter of planning and being able to map out your year or your week, or let's start with the day. It is just being multi-tasking and being available.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eva-longoria><strong>Eva Longoria</strong></h2><p>The role of Gabrielle Solis was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva Longoria</a>’s breakout role that made her famous. We would have to say that Longoria definitely got hotter over the years. There are 13 years between the two photos, and it’s like she hasn’t aged one bit. Since the show has ended, Longoria has been in many different TV shows such as Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Mother Up!, Decline and Fall, Empire, and Telenovela, so it’s apparent that she's been consistently acting since the show ended. She's also set to appear in the remake of Overboard, the movie made famous by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldie Hawn</a>. The movie is currently in post-production. This is what she has to say about making TV shows: “On a television show, you basically make a movie a week. Movies take three months -- it's crazy. They're so slow; it's like vacation to me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=teri-hatcher><strong>Teri Hatcher</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teri Hatcher</a> was one of the original Desperate Housewives, and she's looking just as good as she ever did. Wisteria Lane obviously did all these ladies well. The show was a crazy place, so who knows what went down there? Since the show, Hatcher went right into another series called Jane by Design. She also went on to star in other TV shows like The Odd Couple, Jake and the Never Land Pirates, and Supergirl. She's set to star in a movie that's currently in post-production. She prefers being in TV shows because they allow her more time with her family. “I feel like I'm a stay-at-home mom, which I was for the five years before this. She's [Her daughter's] absolutely been my focus. That's the choice I made. Desperate Housewives is perfect for me. I get to go back to work and still be able to take my daughter to school and pick her up.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=darcy-rose-byrnes><strong>Darcy Rose Byrnes</strong></h2><p>Darcy Rose Byrnes was just a kid when she held her role in Desperate Housewives. Now, she's a young lady and quite a beautiful one at that. So what has she been doing since the show ended? Well, this beauty has done quite well for a young actress, becoming involved in numerous TV shows. Those included The Legend of Korra, Elena of Avalor, Sofia the First, and Spirit Riding Free. It looks as if she's doing quite well for herself and works consistently in Hollywood. She’s been in the industry since she was 3, so she’s one of the lucky ones that was able to go from being a child actress to an adult. She even appeared on The Young and the Restless and, for her portrayal, was nominated for Outstanding Young Actress. This girl seems to be going places, and it'll be fun to see where her career goes.</p><h2 id=marcia-cross><strong>Marcia Cross</strong></h2><p>She has always been a beauty. She has that combination of being cute and sexy all rolled into one, and aging certainly hasn’t changed that. She's been in and out of Hollywood the past five years since the show ended. She was in a few TV movies and then had a guesting appearance on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Recently, she's been on the show Quantico, and she has a movie in post-production. Cross was always more interested in her family than anything else, and we think that’s why she took a break from Hollywood. “When 'Desperate Housewives' ends, I think my girls will be about the kindergarten age. I will be so happy to be there for them through that huge transition.” She’s always been very protective of her family in a lot of ways that don’t involve her career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=felicity-huffman><strong>Felicity Huffman</strong></h2><p>Her hair may have changed, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Huffman</a> is looking better than ever. She’s always been a good actress, and she’s been doing quite well in Hollywood since the show ended. Since the show, she took things slow in Hollywood because she has a strong dedication to her family. She did a few movies and then went on to star in another hit TV show, American Crime. It’s been running for two years now, and she also has a movie in post-production. Huffman looks as beautiful as she always has, but these days, she's feeling the pressures of aging: “I can't wait to get my face lifted, but my husband says, 'No, don't do it.' I think if it makes you feel better, go for it, but it would be nice if it looked good. There are a lot of people out there who are disasters and you think, 'Why did you do that?'”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jesse-metcalfe><strong>Jesse Metcalfe</strong></h2><p>It has to be said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jesse Metcalfe</a> went from being the cute pool boy to a complete hottie. With thirteen years behind him, he's aged extraordinarily well. His career hasn’t done half bad either. Since the end of the series, he's appeared in multiple shows such as Chase, Dallas, 2 Broke Girls, and Chesapeake Shores. He's also been in a couple of TV movies such as God's Not Dead 2 and A Country Wedding. Currently, Metcalfe has three movies in post-production and one in pre-production, so he’s going to have a busy year. This is what Metcalfe has to say about working on TV shows throughout his career: “I think there are shows that are long-running and successful, where some or all of the cast members hate each other, but I think it's a lot easier to have an environment where everyone feels secure and supported to do the best work possible.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-denton><strong>James Denton</strong></h2><p>It’s rare that a handsome man doesn’t age well, and in this case, it looks like Denton has aged quite well. He’s still as handsome as he’s ever been. Having scruff definitely suits this sexy actor. Since the show, he's been in multiple movies and TV movies until he got back into TV, with series such as Good Witch and Devious Maids. He's in the process of filming the movie Selfie Dad. Women were crawling all over him when he was starring in Desperate Housewives, and we can imagine what it was like going out in public with all those horny moms out there. “It slows down grocery shopping because so many women at the store watch the show. I always end up talking to two or three people every time I go to Ralph's. It's fun.” We can just imagine!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ricardo-antonio-chavira><strong>Ricardo Antonio Chavira</strong></h2><p>There's one thing that can make an actor almost unrecognizable, and that’s when they lose their facial hair. He looks good clean-shaven as well, though, so it’s not a big deal. Chavira has been consistently working since Desperate Housewives, acting in many TV shows such as Welcome to the Family, Bad Teacher, and Castle. These days, he's involved with a few popular TV shows such as Santa Clarita Diet, Jane the Virgin, and Scandal. He also has a few movies in post-production. All in all, he's had a successful career since the show. He's a huge supporter of the Breast Cancer movement and acts as an advocate. “I have experienced firsthand the tremendous impact breast cancer has on the women who fight it and the loved ones who support them. This is a disease that catches you unaware and, without the right resources, leaves you feeling frightened and alone.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brenda-strong><strong>Brenda Strong</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brenda Strong</a> has always been a fox; she even played a girlfriend of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry Seinfeld</a>’s on Seinfeld. That was, of course, before her role on Desperate Housewives. Since then, she's been in quite a few TV shows like Supergirl, Fear the Walking Dead, Dallas, The 100, and Blood Relatives. She’s been on one TV show after another, so she doesn’t seem to have a problem getting work. “There are a lot of people who dream of overnight success, of being <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt</a> getting discovered for 'Thelma and Louise,' but that doesn't always happen. I represent that stick-to-it-ness that it takes to build a career over time, guest spot by guest spot. Looking back from here, I wouldn't have wanted the journey to go any other way.” She definitely has a point, and one way or another, she made it.</p><h2 id=kyle-maclachlan><strong>Kyle MacLachlan</strong></h2><p>For the most part, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyle MacLachlan</a> looks the same despite the wrinkles. He still holds the same style as he always did. MacLachlan was always a creepy character in Desperate Housewives, so it’s sometimes hard to separate that feeling in real life. He wasn’t the character that got to have the sexy roles. Before there was Desperate Housewives, he was popular in Sex and the City. Since these shows have ended, MacLachlan has been in numerous shows and has had no problem with maintaining an acting career. He's been seen in Made in Jersey, How I Met Your Mother, Believe, The Good Wife, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Portlandia. This year, he's been involved with the show Twin Peaks. “When the audience first sees Cooper talking into his tape recorder at the beginning of 'Twin Peaks,' I think that's the greatest introduction to a character I've seen in my career. It tells you everything about the guy right there in a few minutes as well as bringing up a whole load of questions.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=doug-savant><strong>Doug Savant</strong></h2><p>We remember Doug Savant from Melrose Place, so it’s not surprising that he ended up on Desperate Housewives. We think Savant got even more handsome as he got older; men are always like that, though. He’s been in a lot of TV shows, not regularly, but in guest spots. He hasn’t had as much success as his peers, but he’s also had consistent work. We’ve seen him in Drop Dead Diva, Criminal Minds, Hawaii Five-0, X-Files, Castle, and Notorious. He hasn’t been seen in anything since 2016, however. “During my first year on Melrose Place (1992), there was a great deal of pressure from the network [Fox TV] for me to out myself as a straight man. The producers of Melrose Place (1992) kept telling me I had to say publicly that I was a breeder. They said too many people assumed I was gay. I know the truth of my life, so I didn't have to play the network game. For three years, I was the spokesperson for the AIDS/Life Cycle-thons in California. I was flattered that people assumed I was gay. To me, that was an affirmation that I was doing my job.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shawn-pyfrom><strong>Shawn Pyfrom</strong></h2><p>Shawn Pyfrom was just a teenager when he was part of the cast of Desperate Housewives. He’s almost unrecognizable these days, but a lot can change in thirteen years when you're a teenager. He definitely turned out to be one handsome guy. Since the show, he hasn’t been that active in Hollywood, unfortunately. He’s had a few bit parts in a TV movie and a TV series but hasn’t done much since 2014. He has a few things in post-production, so we'll have to see what his career has in store for him. Child actors often have a hard time getting the same attention as adults. He's a striking character, though, so hopefully, he'll have more work in the future. He just finished filming The Moleskin Diary, so we'll be tuned in to his role in that movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alfre-woodard><strong>Alfre Woodard</strong></h2><p>Since Desperate Housewives ended, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Woodard</a> has had a great career, though she wasn’t in the series the entire time. From there, she went on to act in multiple TV shows such as My Own Worst Enemy, Black Panther, Three Rivers, Memphis Beat, True Blood, Copper, Luke Cage, and State of Affairs. She also appeared in many movies like Captain America: Civil War, Annabelle, and 12 Years a Slave. Most recently, she's been part of the TV series&nbsp;A Series of Unfortunate Events and has a few movies in post-production. Woodard has no love, however, when it comes to reality TV. “Television studios bet the farm on reality shows, where they didn't need any actors, and movie studios had no plans for any quality movies that required the presence of me.” There’s certainly some truth in that; reality TV doesn’t require the same budget as TV and movies do.</p><p><strong>Source: closerweekly.com</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWawoJGperW0xGaamqukYrynecOeqqmdopbBpnnHqKysnaeew6a%2FjKWmqKOjYrmqt8Rmq6icka58</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-the-cast-of-desperate-housewives-looks-like-today.html&text=What%20The%20Cast%20Of%20Desperate%20Housewives%20Looks%20Like%20Today%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-the-cast-of-desperate-housewives-looks-like-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-the-cast-of-desperate-housewives-looks-like-today.html&title=What%20The%20Cast%20Of%20Desperate%20Housewives%20Looks%20Like%20Today%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-the-cast-of-desperate-housewives-looks-like-today.html&title=What%20The%20Cast%20Of%20Desperate%20Housewives%20Looks%20Like%20Today%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-the-cast-of-desperate-housewives-looks-like-today.html&title=What%20The%20Cast%20Of%20Desperate%20Housewives%20Looks%20Like%20Today%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-the-cast-of-desperate-housewives-looks-like-today.html&description=What%20The%20Cast%20Of%20Desperate%20Housewives%20Looks%20Like%20Today%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-rachel-rush-taylor-hall-wife-or-girlfriend-revealed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Rachel Rush?
