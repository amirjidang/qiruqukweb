Brown has had multiple high-profile relationships, and some of them have produced children.</p><p>He is now the proud father to three children with three baby mamas. The relationships with these women are all incredibly different.

Over time, however, Brown and the women decided to put the best interests of the children first and put any petty arguments behind them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Brown has a past that is marred with domestic violence and anger management issues, there do not appear to be any current legal issues pending between himself, Nia Guzman, Ammika Harris, or Diamond Brown. In fact, the women clearly feel confident in Brown's ability to parent, given that in April 2023, he posted a picture where he was posing with all three of his children in his home. As such, the siblings are getting to know one another versus being estranged and Brown is being a present father.</p><p>Whether any of these co-parenting relationships will ever turn into something romantic is anyone's guess. Currently, Brown is not dating any of the women who had his children and is single.</p><h2 id=who-are-chris-brown-39-s-children-and-who-are-their-mothers>Who Are Chris Brown's Children And Who Are Their Mothers?</h2><p>Brown became a father for the first time when Nia Guzman gave birth to their daughter, Royalty, on ​​May 27, 2014. In the beginning, their co-parenting relationship was rocky, and the pair were involved in court battles over the custody of their daughter. Brown also temporarily <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stopped paying child support</a> after allegedly being denied visitation of Royalty in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since that time, their relationship has significantly improved, and they now <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have a great co-parenting relationship</a>.</p><p>"So I have a co-parenting job that's pretty amazing but, you know, learning how to be a dad, especially learning how to take care of somebody else, you know, I barely know how to brush my teeth in the morning!" Brown explained. "It's actually great. It's very humbling. You know, it's very calming. I think I was a lot, you know, rambunctious, very hyper as a kid, but now seeing that ten times over, my daughter's kinda like mellowing me out."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chris-brown-and-royalty-brown-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He would become a father a second time with model Ammika Harris. The pair had a son, Aeko Brown, <a href=#>who looks identical to Brown</a>, born on Nov. 20, 2019. Co-parenting with Harris would be a little more challenging because of their different geographical locations. She is based in Germany and chose to quarantine there during the pandemic. However, the pair managed to find a way to work around this with the help of technology.</p><p>Then in 2022, he welcomed his third child with Diamond Brown, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brown was known to date on-and-off in the three years leading up to Diamond getting pregnant</a>. The couple had a daughter, Lovely Symphani, born on Jan. 7, 2022.

"His priorities have completely shifted, and he's matured so much over these past few years since becoming a father."</p><p>"The best part of being a dad, you know, doing those little things," Brown explained to E! News. "Bedtime is crazy for me 'cause I always was like... trying to avoid bedtime when I was a kid, like, 'No, Mom, just 15 more minutes, please!' So I'll keep like the kids' channel on and turn it all the way low and turn all the lights out, and you know, I'll lay in the bed with her and like rub her back until she actually falls asleep.

They stay in touch all the time and are constantly FaceTiming, so Chris is able to keep up with Aeko as he's growing," a source told HollywoodLife.
