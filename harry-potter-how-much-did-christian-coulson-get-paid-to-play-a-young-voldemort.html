While not everyone on the cast was quite so successful, most of the actors boast some combination of wealth and fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p style=text-align:left>Christian Coulson, who rose to prominence in his role as Tom Riddle, is no exception to this rule. The British heartthrob has done so well for himself that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Net Worth Post&nbsp;estimates he is at least a millionaire</a>. But what does he do with all of his cash? We have taken a closer look at Coulson’s lifestyle to get a feel for how the star spends his money.</p><p style=text-align:left><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is This The Last Harry Potter Movie Ever?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-simple-side-of-life>The Simple Side&nbsp;Of Life</h2><p>Coulson might have the deep pockets to help him afford fancy dinners and nights on the town, but the actor seems truly fascinated by the world’s natural beauty. The&nbsp;Harry Potter&nbsp;star shares his most simple pleasures via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a very artsy Instagram account</a>, which features photos of landscapes and animals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One shot captures a cloud hanging over the open sea. Another photo zooms in on a cluster of snails clinging to a beachside rock. What could be the actor’s simplest frame shows an inflatable rainbow in a driveway, bringing an extraordinary splash of color to a typical neighborhood scene. So lovely!</p><p>These pictures show that Coulson is not focused on throwing himself into the high life. On the contrary, he seems invested in appreciating the world around him through walks through nature. His account also shows that he enjoys making artwork- like photographs -as a way to document the incredible things we see on a daily basis. For Coulson, it seems, the best things in life are free.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eddie Redmayne Crushed On Some Strange ‘Disney’ Characters As A Kid</a></span></p><h2 id=a-touch-of-wanderlust>A Touch Of Wanderlust</h2><p>Even though Coulson has an eye for simple beauty, he is not afraid to spoil himself by going on a trip or two. The actor has traveled across the globe and captured his experiences in gorgeous outdoor settings on more than one continent.</p><p>Just this past December, Coulson took a very chic vacation to Cape Town, South Africa, where he hiked in the mountains and soaked up coastal views. He traveled with his partner in crime and year-round Valentine Nic Walter, who joined him on romantic walks among incredible landscapes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is not the only fancy trip that Coulson embarked on previous to the COVID-19 pandemic. He and Walter flew across the Earth to Japan, where they explored new viewpoints, filmed koi ponds and explored exhibits at the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo.</p><p>Naturally, he has also made stops in Paris and New York, where Walter is based. On these trips, the couple stopped at more museums- including the Guggenheim -and snapped classic photos of urban street art. However, there is no sign of Coulson making crazy purchases à la sex, drugs and rock-n-roll.</p><p>Coulson may not exactly be flying through cash in the way that most Hollywood actors do, but he sure doesn’t have any problem enjoying his success through expensive and interesting journeys around the globe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which Emma Watson Movie Are You, Based On Your Zodiac Sign?</a></span></p><h2 id=a-passion-for-the-arts>A Passion For The Arts</h2><p>Sometimes, we work for money; other times, we work for love. This certainly seems to be Coulson’s attitude, as he has not let his fame get in the way of picking up passion projects. Rather than limit himself to Hollywood films and high-paying television shows, the actor has used his cash to support himself... all while dedicating himself to the art of acting itself.</p><p>For Coulson, that means that he has not been afraid to lend his talent to the lower-paying vocation of the theater.&nbsp;The actor’s social media show several shots of him on the stage and in the spotlight. In 2015, he opened up about his love for the theater <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview with&nbsp;</a>Stage Buddy.&nbsp;“Acting is my love... I love being onstage in front of an audience,” he told the outlet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, he did not hold back from expressing his passion for being in front of the camera, as well: “I really love the process of filming... I love the craft of being one of like a hundred people creating something that goes on film. Last year, I went to Nantucket and made a movie for eight weeks, and there’s something really lovely, almost monastic about getting up in the morning and just focusing on it every day.”</p><p>It is fair to say that Coulson is far from being the typical Hollywood star. He spends his money slowly in a way that allows him to enjoy life to the fullest—through travel, photography and acting for the sake of art.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is How Harry Potter’s Tom Felton Spends His $53 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifmqqirnqxu9OtnKtlmKTEbrnUnJ9mnJmZeqS00aKqraGRo3qku9SlqqimXZyytXnPmqCdZaSkerG4wLJkmmWppMKvs4yvpqWclaK8s8CO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fharry-potter-how-much-did-christian-coulson-get-paid-to-play-a-young-voldemort.html&text=How%20Much%20Did%20Christian%20Coulson%20Get%20Paid%20To%20Play%20A%20Young%20Voldemort%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fharry-potter-how-much-did-christian-coulson-get-paid-to-play-a-young-voldemort.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fharry-potter-how-much-did-christian-coulson-get-paid-to-play-a-young-voldemort.html&title=How%20Much%20Did%20Christian%20Coulson%20Get%20Paid%20To%20Play%20A%20Young%20Voldemort%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fharry-potter-how-much-did-christian-coulson-get-paid-to-play-a-young-voldemort.html&title=How%20Much%20Did%20Christian%20Coulson%20Get%20Paid%20To%20Play%20A%20Young%20Voldemort%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fharry-potter-how-much-did-christian-coulson-get-paid-to-play-a-young-voldemort.html&title=How%20Much%20Did%20Christian%20Coulson%20Get%20Paid%20To%20Play%20A%20Young%20Voldemort%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fharry-potter-how-much-did-christian-coulson-get-paid-to-play-a-young-voldemort.html&description=How%20Much%20Did%20Christian%20Coulson%20Get%20Paid%20To%20Play%20A%20Young%20Voldemort%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-money-does-flatbush-zombies-make-latest-flatbush-zombies-net-worth-income-salary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Flatbush Zombies Make?
