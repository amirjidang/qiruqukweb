She is thriving and leaving an indelible mark on pop culture. Throughout her illustrious career, marked by chart-topping hits and a colorful foray into film, Parton also faced personal challenges that led her to make decisions she later regretted.</p><p>As is common with many public figures, concerns have arisen about her health as she has aged. After all, Parton has previously battled health issues. Unfortunately, the beloved country music icon has been the target of unfounded health scare rumors and even death hoaxes.</p><h2 id=did-dolly-parton-have-a-terminal-illness>Did Dolly Parton Have A Terminal Illness?</h2><p>In 2013, The National Enquirer revealed that Dolly Parton had undergone an esophageal cancer screening procedure. Allegedly, she had a secret esophagectomy in June 2013 to implant a medical device in her esophagus, as she had been battling gastroesophageal reflux disease for years, which can lead to esophageal cancer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/why-dolly-parton-marrying-carl-dean-was-one-of-the-most-rebellious-things-she-ever-did.jpg><p>A source reportedly claimed that her significant weight loss during that time was attributed to her illness, surgery, and medication. "Her weight was dropping dramatically, she was chugging antacid medication, and she couldn't eat anything but soft, bland foods." Parton's team declined to comment on the rumors.</p><p>In 2015, Parton faced more health concerns when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors of her having stomach cancer</a> started to circulate. The National Enquirer reported again that she had been rushed to the hospital. These rumors surfaced when she underwent surgery to remove kidney stones which went smoothly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/did-kenny-rogers-steamy-relationship-with-dolly-parton-make-any-of-his-five-ex-wives-jealous_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Did Kenny Rogers' Steamy Relationship with Dolly Parton Make Any Of His Five Ex-Wives Jealous?">Did Kenny Rogers' Steamy Relationship with Dolly Parton Make Any Of His Five Ex-Wives Jealous?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton's decades-long friendship was a hotbed of mutual teasing and flirtation.</p><p>Parton spoke to Billboard to clarify the rumors, "It's true that I had kidney stones. I had them removed three weeks ago, and I am doing just fine! There is absolutely no truth at all that I have stomach cancer. I love and appreciate everyone's concern," she added.</p><h2 id=dolly-parton-became-a-target-of-an-internet-death-hoax>Dolly Parton Became A Target Of An Internet Death Hoax</h2><p>In 2022, social media buzzed with news of Dolly Parton suffering from a serious ailment and even claimed that she was on life support. These rumors were debunked by Snopes, a fact-checking site after its origin was revealed in an unreliable YouTube video.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dolly-parton.jpg><p>At the time of the rumor, the country legend had been actively making public appearances and doing shows that’s why people were stunned to learn about the fake news.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2023, another online death hoax targeted Parton. A Facebook post in October 2023 falsely claimed her death, causing hundreds of fans to express condolences and sorrow. Fortunately, Parton's representatives swiftly dispelled the rumors with a statement posted on her Instagram story, "She joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. She's still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet."</p><h2 id=dolly-parton-debunked-rumors-that-affected-her-body-image>Dolly Parton Debunked Rumors That Affected Her Body Image</h2><p>Dolly Parton addressed the outrageous rumors that claimed her breasts were so massive that they had damaged her back. During an interview with ET Canada, the country music icon was asked to clarify some wild rumors about her personal life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dolly-parton.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Parton began by referring to a National Enquirer report that suggested her breasts had left her crippled. "Oh, heavens, I've heard everything… And I thought, well, they are big, and they are heavy, but I can still get around... I'm doing all right," she stated.</p><p>Another persistent rumor concerns Parton's choice to not wear sleeveless outfits in public which led to speculations about her alleged concealed full-sleeve tattoos and a scalp tattoo beneath her wigs. She acknowledged the existence of her few tattoos and shared <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the reason behind her body art</a> with Vanity Fair.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/carl-thomas-dean-lives-a-very-secretive-life-despite-being-married-to-dolly-parton-edited-copy.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Beatles Were Praised For This Song, But Dolly Parton Made It Even More Famous">The Beatles Were Praised For This Song, But Dolly Parton Made It Even More Famous</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Dolly Parton borrowed a song from The Beatles when it was already a hit, and it got even better.</p><p>"... most of the tattoos when I first started, I was covering up some scars that I had, 'cause I have a tendency to have keloid scar tissue, and I have a tendency where if I have any kind of scars anywhere then they kind of have a purple tinge that I can never get rid of. So mine are all pastels, what few that I have, and they're meant to cover some scars. I'm not trying to make some big, bold statement." Parton shared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dolly-parton-struggled-with-her-mental-health-after-her-heartbreaking-health-diagnosis>Dolly Parton Struggled With Her Mental Health After Her Heartbreaking Health Diagnosis</h2><p>In 1981, Dolly Parton received a diagnosis of endometriosis, a condition characterized by the growth of tissues outside the uterus, causing inflammation in the pelvis and other parts of the body.</p><p>In the months leading up to her diagnosis, she endured severe abdominal pain and bleeding, which ultimately resulted in her collapsing on stage during her show in Indianapolis. Parton underwent two surgeries to prevent internal hemorrhaging, and at 36 years old, she had a partial hysterectomy to manage her illness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I went to the very bottom as far as my emotions and my health are concerned. I was getting away with murder. I wasn't watching what I ate, I wasn't conscious of nutrition, wasn't taking care of myself. I was working hard, and underneath I was a pile of personal and emotional problems. All at once I fell apart. It was stomach problems and female problems – all over health problems, actually." Parton recalled in her two-hour documentary titled, Dolly Parton: The Queen of Country. The surgery meant that <a href=#>she could no longer conceive children naturally</a> and admitted that she went through a dark phase until she managed to pull herself out of it.</p><p>In addition to her diagnosis and medical warnings, Parton's health struggles persisted. Despite being on medication for her stomach and reproductive issues, she still engaged in extreme diets, and referred to herself as "Dietin' Dolly."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="A Breakdown Of Dolly Parton's Insane $650 Million Net Worth">A Breakdown Of Dolly Parton's Insane $650 Million Net Worth</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Dolly Parton's wealth is not just a result of her music career; she has many income streams including her own theme park and her own record label.</p><p>"On top of being medicated, Dietin' Dolly would go on liquid protein, Scarsdale, Atkins, the water diet, then I'd binge, diet, gain, start all over again. Eventually, my system wouldn't work anymore. My body couldn't hold up under that strain. Overeating is as much a sickness as drugs or alcohol," she explained.</p><p>This combination of steroids, antibiotics, and unhealthy lifestyle choices led to rapid and unhealthy weight gain. Parton, with her previous petite physique, gained 50 pounds. She admitted that she could eat three pizzas and still crave fries, popcorn, and McDonald's before going on a strict diet again. Fortunately, her doctors convinced her to switch to a balanced diet, which helped her lose 20 pounds and regain her health.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqKScrnqxrdGtpqdlmJqurcDHZqCsq6WaeqWxwK2fZqCflsWmv4yiqmarmJp6s7HApaOyZaOesKx7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdolly-parton-health-issue-death-hoaxes-is-she-really-sick.html&text=Dolly%20Parton%20Has%20Been%20Plagued%20By%20Health%20Issue%20Rumors%20And%20Death%20Hoaxes%2c%20Here%27s%20Whether%20She%27s%20Really%20S&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdolly-parton-health-issue-death-hoaxes-is-she-really-sick.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdolly-parton-health-issue-death-hoaxes-is-she-really-sick.html&title=Dolly%20Parton%20Has%20Been%20Plagued%20By%20Health%20Issue%20Rumors%20And%20Death%20Hoaxes%2c%20Here%27s%20Whether%20She%27s%20Really%20S" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdolly-parton-health-issue-death-hoaxes-is-she-really-sick.html&title=Dolly%20Parton%20Has%20Been%20Plagued%20By%20Health%20Issue%20Rumors%20And%20Death%20Hoaxes%2c%20Here%27s%20Whether%20She%27s%20Really%20S" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdolly-parton-health-issue-death-hoaxes-is-she-really-sick.html&title=Dolly%20Parton%20Has%20Been%20Plagued%20By%20Health%20Issue%20Rumors%20And%20Death%20Hoaxes%2c%20Here%27s%20Whether%20She%27s%20Really%20S" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdolly-parton-health-issue-death-hoaxes-is-she-really-sick.html&description=Dolly%20Parton%20Has%20Been%20Plagued%20By%20Health%20Issue%20Rumors%20And%20Death%20Hoaxes%2c%20Here%27s%20Whether%20She%27s%20Really%20S" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./make-money-by-selling-custom-merchandise-on-redbubble.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Earn Cash with Redbubble Custom Merch Sales">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./did-sam-taylor-johnson-divorce-jay-jopling-date-much-younger-aaron-taylor-johnson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Sam Taylor-Johnson Really Divorce Jay Jopling Just To Have A Relationship With The Much Younger ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
