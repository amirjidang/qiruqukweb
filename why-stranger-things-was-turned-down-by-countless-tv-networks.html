This thrilling sci-fi series, created by the Duffer Brothers, emerged as a cultural phenomenon when it first hit Netflix in July 2016. Since then, it has not only captivated audiences worldwide but has also redefined the possibilities for storytelling in the modern era.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stranger Things quickly established itself as a breakout hit. Its gripping narrative, nostalgic nods to '80s pop culture, and a talented ensemble cast drew viewers of all ages into its enigmatic world. According to data from Netflix, the show achieved record-breaking success, with tens of millions of households streaming the third season within its first four days of release in 2019.</p><p>One of the standout features of Stranger Things was its remarkable young cast, whose exceptional performances helped drive the show's success. The ensemble included talented actors such as Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, and Noah Schnapp, all of whom were in their early teens when the series began.</p><p>The chemistry with the young cast was a major selling point for fans, but behind the scenes, it was a point of contention for studios.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Joe Keery Cheat On Maika Monroe Leading To Their Mysterious Breakup?

Unfortunately, many networks had problems with the young cast. In fact, the show was rejected by at least 15 networks early on.</p><p>"You either gotta make it into a kids show or make it about this Hopper [detective] character investigating paranormal activity around town,'" Matt remembered one producer telling him. “Then we lose everything interesting about the show ... There was a week where we were like, ‘This isn’t going to work because people don’t get it,’” the site reported.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being rejected that many times was a tough pill to swallow, but the Duffers knew that they just needed one person to be on board. That person was none other than producer Shawn Levy.</p><p>"The Duffer brothers came in, and within 10 minutes I knew that these were future major guys. “They had a self-assurance that was self-evident. So, we pitched it to Netflix, and within 24 hours, we had the whole season bought. We decided that we would direct all of the episodes ourselves," Levy said in an interview.</p><p>Just like that everything changed, and the show found its way to Netflix. From there, the Duffers realized their vision, and they turned Stranger Things into one of the biggest television shows of its era.</p><p>The show has had four brilliant season, and a 5th is on the way!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Millie Bobby Brown Has Been A Magnet For Scandal, Here's The Truth About Her Most Shocking Controversies</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=here-39-s-what-39-s-going-on-with-season-5>Here's What's Going On With Season 5</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/strangerthings_strangerthings4_9_02_14_28_08.jpg><p>With the strike going on in Hollywood, the series' final season has been put on the backburner. That said, it's still happening, and it's going to be some time before it comes out.</p><p>Little is known about the show's final season. It's speculated that there will be a time jump. This is good news, as the once-young cast will be in teir early 20s by the time things are able to get underway.</p><p>Steve Harrington actor, Joe Keery, spoke about the bittersweet nature of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the show ending</a>.</p><p>"It won’t be easy for it to end.
