The good news is when that happens, you usually only embarrass yourself in front of a small group of people and you're unlikely to find your dumb statement on the cover of a magazine.&nbsp;However, that's one luxury celebrities don't have. Anything they say or do is inspected under a magnifying glass. When they say something stupid, and that's when&nbsp;not if, because that's just part of being human, it could follow them around forever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sometimes people say things without thinking that are completely harmless and bring only laughs to those who hear it, and no harm is done. Other times, thoughtless comments result in hurt feelings. Sometimes, these statements aren't thoughtless, but rather reflective of the speaker's beliefs. If these beliefs are unpopular and controversial&nbsp;that celebrity may suffer consequences more extensive than just a damaged reputation. Some of these celebrities lose out on roles and are dropped from contracts&nbsp;and&nbsp;companies who don't want to be associated with celebs shrouded in controversy.</p><p>They might have millions of dollars and the best of the best of everything, but one thing celebrities obviously don't have is anonymity. Thanks to this lack of anonymity, we get t0 hear all about their lives, and sometimes their lives include them putting their foot in their mouth. And when a celebrity puts their foot in their mouth, there isn't a table in the world big enough to hide them from the ensuing embarrassment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here are 15 of the dumbest things celebrities have ever said.</p><h2 id=heidi-montag>15. Heidi Montag</h2><p>"God knows the truth in all of this, and at the end of the day, that is the only thing that matters. Jesus was persecuted, and I'm going to get persecuted, ya know?"</p><p><a href=#>Heidi Montag</a> is best known for her role on MTV's reality show&nbsp;The Hills and her marriage to the equally outspoken <a href=#>Spencer Pratt</a>.&nbsp;Though the show was <a href=#>admittedly quite scripted</a>, Montag played a very convincing role as a <a href=#>Lauren Conrad</a>'s sometimes ditzy frenemy. Montag lived up to that role off screen too, and one of the only things people know&nbsp;her for other than her&nbsp;plastic surgery, is some of the ridiculous comments she has made. This shocking&nbsp;quote where she thought it was appropriate to compare herself to Jesus Christ was in reference to being accused of&nbsp;spreading rumours of&nbsp;the existence of a Lauren Conrad sex tape.</p><p></p><h2 id=kim-kardashian>14. Kim Kardashian</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"But I think that, with any decisions in life, like, I spoke to a girl today who had cancer and we were talking about how this is such a hard thing for her, but it taught her a big lesson on who her friends are and so much about life. She's 18. And I was like, that's how I feel."</p><p><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, 34, &nbsp;is an incredibly popular television personality and fashion designer, who is regularly criticized for being famous for no good reason. Her life is the subject of constant criticism, and that includes her romantic relationships. Though she is now married to her third husband, rapper <a href=#>Kanye West</a>, Kardashian had a very rocky relationship with her second husband, NBA player <a href=#>Kris Humphreys</a>. The couple&nbsp;were married for a quick 72 days, and she thought it was fair to compare her relationship struggles with that of a young cancer patient.</p><p></p><h2 id=arnold-schwarzenegger>13. Arnold Schwarzenegger</h2><p>“I think gay marriage is something that should be between a man and a woman.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although <a href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>'s career began with him being titled Mr. Universe at age 20, and then titled Mr. Olympia seven times as well, he took his turn at politics and was the governor of California from 2003-2011. California was the second American state to legalize gay marriage, and of course, Schwarzenegger gave his two cents on the topic. Unfortunately, his opinion was completely illogical&nbsp;and became a funny one-liner that was quite damaging to his reputation.</p><p></p><h2 id=12-sean-connery>12.&nbsp; Sean Connery</h2><p>“I don't think there is anything particularly wrong about hitting a woman,” he said. “An openhanded slap is justified — if all other alternatives fail and there has been plenty of warning. If a woman is a bitch, or hysterical, or bloody-minded continually, then I'd do it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a 1965 interview with Playboy magazine, <a href=#>Sean Connery</a>, who was at the height of his fame thanks to his role as James Bond in the Bond films, made some incredibly archaic (even for 1965) and offensive remarks about women and violence. Connery, then 34, may have said this 50 years ago, but it certainly hasn't been forgotten. He took a lot of heat for his sexist remarks and that reputation follows him to this day.</p><p></p><h2 id=shaquille-o-neal>11. Shaquille O'Neal</h2><p>“I can’t really remember the names of the clubs that we went to.”</p><p>Although 7'1" basketball superstar <a href=#>Shaquille O'Neal</a> has a rather extensive post-secondary education, that education doesn't appear to have involved any facts about historically important and famous landmarks. This was Shaq's response when he was asked if he visited the Parthenon, a former temple on the Athenian Acropolis, when he visited Greece.</p><p></p><h2 id=terrence-howard>10. Terrence Howard</h2><p>"Toilet paper - and no baby wipes - in the bathroom. If they're using dry paper, they aren't washing all of themselves. It's just unclean. So if I go in a woman's house and see the toilet paper there, I'll explain this. And if she doesn't make the adjustment to baby wipes, I'll know she's not completely clean."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Actor <a href=#>Terrence Howard</a>&nbsp;has a history of being outspoken. Although this statement isn't overtly offensive, it certainly is comical and it was completely unnecessary for him to share this opinion so publicly. Howard has also been the butt of many jokes after sharing that he is most attracted to women that look like him.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-brooke-shields>9.&nbsp;Brooke Shields</h2><p>"Smoking kills. If you're killed, you've lost a very important part of your life."</p><p><a href=#>Brooke Shields</a> technically isn't incorrect,&nbsp;but that doesn't make this sentence any less mindless. The 49-year-old actress&nbsp;and Princeton grad was chosen to be the spokesperson for a major anti-smoking campaign in 1981. Unfortunately, Shields made this silly statement during an interview regarding the campaign. The resulting backlash about&nbsp;her comment largely over-shadowed the campaign's intended message.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-tom-cruise>8.&nbsp; Tom Cruise</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When you're a Scientologist, and you drive by an accident, you know you have to do something about it, because you know you're the only one who can really help. We are the authorities on getting people off drugs. We are the authorities on the mind.... We are the way to happiness. "</p><p>Although <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a>, 52, has been a big star since his leading role in 1983's&nbsp;Risky Business,&nbsp;his participation in the Church of Scientology has been the topic of discussion much more than his career has been for the&nbsp;last several years.&nbsp;Followers of the religion may have beliefs that&nbsp;seem a little untraditional but to tell the world that you are somewhat of a superhero may not always go over well.</p><p></p><h2 id=nicole-richie>7. Nicole Richie</h2><p>"When I pictured heroin, I pictured some crazy crackhead with no shoes under a bridge. You never think that is going to be you. And it never was me. I was never under a bridge, and I always had shoes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Nicole Richie</a>, 33, is the adopted daughter of singer <a href=#>Lionel Richie</a>. Though she is now a happy and healthy wife to singer <a href=#>Joel Madden</a> and a mother of two young children, the television personality previously struggled with substance abuse. Richie made this unfortunate statement insinuating a heroin addiction is under control provided you are wearing shoes and you don't live under a bridge, and of course, the press had a field day with it.</p><p></p><h2 id=r-kelly>6. R. Kelly</h2><p>"All of a sudden you're like the Bin Laden of America. Osama Bin Laden is the only one who knows what I'm going through."</p><p><a href=#>R. Kelly</a> is a rapper who has seen his fair share of controversy and legal issues. He was sued for $10 million in 1997 for having sex with an underage girl (she 15 and he 24 at the time). Then, in 2003 a video surfaced that allegedly showed Kelly engaging in sexual acts and urinating on an underage girl. Of course,&nbsp;since then his reputation has been irreparably damaged. In regard to the public's reaction to his crimes, Kelly chose to compare himself to the now deceased Osama Bin Laden, which certainly did not improve his reputation at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=mariah-carey>5. Mariah Carey</h2><p>"Whenever I watch TV and see those poor starving kids all over the world, I can't help but cry. I mean I'd love to be skinny like that but not with all those flies and death and stuff."</p><p>Celebrities are often criticized for comparing their struggles to those who live in poverty or in any circumstances less glamorous than that of a celebrity. Singer&nbsp;<a href=#>Mariah Carey</a>&nbsp;allegedly took that to a whole new level&nbsp;when she way over-shot comparing herself to those living in poverty and instead expressed jealousy of their skinny physiques. Carey, 45, experienced&nbsp;a harsh backlash from the general public for her insensitive comment in 1996.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-jessica-simpson>4.&nbsp; Jessica Simpson</h2><p>"I'm not anorexic. I'm from Texas. Are there people from Texas that are anorexic? I've never heard of one. And that includes me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She's certainly no stranger to&nbsp;being&nbsp;laughed at for some of the things she has said, but singer and fashion designer <a href=#>Jessica Simpson</a> made people angry with this insensitive comment in 2005. Simpson's fluctuating weight is often the subject of many news stories.&nbsp;No matter what size she is, the media will claim she is either anorexic or overweight. This comment seems to be her attempt at denying those rumors, however it instead emphasized other rumors about her intelligence.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-sienna-miller>3.&nbsp; Sienna Miller</h2><p>“I love cigarettes. Love them. I think the more positive approach you have to smoking, the less harmful it is."</p><p><a href=#>Sienna Miller</a> has a lot of things going for her. She is a beautiful and successful actress with an incredibly impressive body of work. However, her "positive" attitude about smoking completely denies scientific facts and doesn't speak well to her level of knowledge on the subject. While a positive attitude is a great thing to have, smoking is smoking and thanks to the harmful chemicals in cigarettes, it is harmful no matter how good your attitude is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=kanye-west>2. Kanye West</h2><p>“Sometimes people write novels and they just be so wordy and self-absorbed. I am not a fan of books. I would never want a book’s autograph. I am a proud non-reader of books.”</p><p>Oh, <a href=#>Kanye West</a>. Where to begin? The rapper digs&nbsp;holes so deep for himself there isn't a rope in the world long enough to pull him out of them. For a man whose level of intelligence is often questioned, announcing you aren't a fan of books won't do much to help your reputation. Maybe he has changed his tune since his wife <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> released her own book. Lucky for West, the book consists of mostly pictures.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-john-travolta>1.&nbsp; John Travolta</h2><p>“Tom Cruise has – we all have – the right to practice how we feel…Don’t judge someone until they have tossed your salad."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When actor <a href=#>John Travolta</a> defended fellow Scientologist for some of his outrageous claims, he ended up saying something equally as outrageous. In a rather innocent attempt to stick up for his friend's beliefs and statements, he tried a new spin on "Don't judge someone until you've walked a mile in their shoes," and, well, it didn't go over so smoothly. Good try though, John.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>huffingtonpost.com</a>, <a href=#>news.com.au</a>, <a href=#>gawker.com</a>, <a href=#>posh24.com</a>, <a href=#>news.com.au</a>, <a href=#>foxnews.com</a>, <a href=#>thehollywoodgossip.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqbV2ks27Ax55kna2dl7K0wIytn6Kml6h6pLHLnpmroaSesrR5x5qtnmWVq7KzedKaoJ1n</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-of-the-dumbest-things-celebrities-have-ever-said.html&text=Top%2015%20Most%20Embarrassing%20Celebrity%20Quotes&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-of-the-dumbest-things-celebrities-have-ever-said.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-of-the-dumbest-things-celebrities-have-ever-said.html&title=Top%2015%20Most%20Embarrassing%20Celebrity%20Quotes" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-of-the-dumbest-things-celebrities-have-ever-said.html&title=Top%2015%20Most%20Embarrassing%20Celebrity%20Quotes" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-of-the-dumbest-things-celebrities-have-ever-said.html&title=Top%2015%20Most%20Embarrassing%20Celebrity%20Quotes" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-of-the-dumbest-things-celebrities-have-ever-said.html&description=Top%2015%20Most%20Embarrassing%20Celebrity%20Quotes" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tracy-austin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tracy Austin Net Worth, Age, Height, Husband, Family, Wiki 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./beverly-hills-90210-cast-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Cast Of Beverly Hills 90210's Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
