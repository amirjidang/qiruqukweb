These ultra-famous celebrities need their own private jets, of course. While some celebrities do choose to fly through commercial flights like the rest of us, here are 10 A-list celebrities that invested in their own air transportation.</p><h2 id=kylie-jenner>Kylie Jenner</h2><p><a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> is known famous for many things, mostly superficial like cosmetic surgery, but she is also known for her makeup and skin brands. Kylie recently took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to post pictures of her customized, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Skin branded private jet</a>.</p><p>Not only is the exterior of the jet completely decked out with the Kylie Skin label, but the guests flying on this jet had matching Kylie Skin loungewear as well as silk pillows and eye masks for the long flight. As if just owning a customized private jet wasn’t enough, Kylie also had the flight attendants in customized pink outfits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jim-carrey>Jim Carrey</h2><p>Jim Carrey has been around for decades, in some of the world’s most beloved films like The Grinch, The Mask, and many more classics. With such levels of fame comes perks and luxury, like owning a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">private jet</a>.</p><p>When buying your own aircraft, you’re looking at at least a few millions of dollars. Jim Carrey must have money to burn because his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gulfstream V</a>. Was well over $40 million. The Gulfstream is known for its high-performance and safety and is considered one of the best private jets on the market.</p><h2 id=drake>Drake</h2><p>Well known, Canadian rapper, <a href=#>Drake</a> is the proud owner of a Boeing 76<i>7. </i>He posted a clip to Instagram showing the exterior of the customized plane which is baby blue in color and features his well-known owl logo as well as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“Air Drake”</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things Everyone Does When They Become Rich</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This particular plane can seat up to 30 people and is valued at just under $200 million, not including all the customization that Drake requested. Drake has had tremendous influence in the music industry over the last decade, and this private jet is definitely well deserved.</p><h2 id=cardi-b>Cardi B</h2><p>Cardi B has not made her private jet a secret. For those who don’t know Cardi B’s story, she was a case of “started from the bottom, now we’re here.” Previously stripping for money, Cardi has now gained a substantial following and is married to Migos member, Offset. Offset and Cardi B have both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">opened up</a> about the purchase, claiming it’s all for Kulture.</p><p>Cardi has been quite private about her daughter, not releasing many pictures of her daughter’s face up until this year. Supposedly, the private jet is to continue this privacy and the purchase was in the name of love for Kulture.</p><h2 id=conor-mcgregor>Conor McGregor</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, <a href=#>UFC</a> star Conor McGregor earned approximately $47 million in 2019 alone including winnings and endorsements. The Irish fighter posted a heartwarming <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photo</a> of himself and his son in front of a private jet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He captioned the picture “We must always work hard, my son. Working hard is what got us here!” This inspirational message is McGregor’s way of showing how he fought his way to the top (and to a private jet) with hard work and determination. McGregor has since posted a few photos featuring his private jet, certainly proud of his achievements.</p><h2 id=celine-dion>Celine Dion</h2><p>Canadian singer Celine Dion is not afraid to show off her private plane. Celine Dion is a fashion icon and is known for luxury, always sporting an outfit to die for and a killer bag. Though the ultimate purchase owned by this class-act is her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bombardier BD 700 Global Express XRS</a>, valued at an estimated $42 million.</p><p>This particular jet is fully equipped with multiple bathrooms and a functional kitchen. Talk about traveling in style! In terms of luxury purchases, clothing trends come and go, but private jets are forever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jay-z>Jay Z</h2><p>Jay Z and Beyoncé may be the most famous (and richest) couple in the world. Some may even argue that their daughter’s name Blue Ivy was the beginning of the unusual celebrity child name trend. With both Jay Z and Beyoncé holding multiple award-winning and highly-recognized albums, a private jet was never out of the budget for the pair.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 People Who Became Millionaires Overnight And How They Did It</a></span></p><p>Beyoncé takes the prize for best wife, gifting a private jet to her husband back in 2012. Jay Z’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bombardier Challenger 850</a> is an estimated $40 million dollars, including full bathrooms, TV’s, kitchen and much more.</p><h2 id=john-travolta>John Travolta</h2><p><a href=#>John Travolta</a> is not only an A-list actor but also an airplane enthusiast! Travolta not only has one private jet but multiple ones. He’s a certified pilot and is extremely passionate about his planes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He loves his planes so much that his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">house doubles as an airport</a>. Travolta bought land in the residential airpark, Jumbolair Aviation Estates. The property came with a private runway. While acting is still his career, aviation is his hobby and passion. John Travolta could not have picked a more expensive hobby if he tried! Not only did he go big, he went home too and made it an airport.</p><h2 id=jeffree-star>Jeffree Star</h2><p><a href=#>Jeffree Star </a>is the creator and owner of popular makeup brand <i>Jeffree Star Cosmetics. </i>His YouTube Channel has over 15 million subscribers alone. He was featured in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mini-documentary series</a> produced by other YouTuber Shane Dawson, in which we learned that <a href=#>Jeffree Star </a>not only makes music but has other businesses on the side, including a merchandise production company.</p><p>In the docu-series, Shane Dawson and Jeffree Star take a ride in his personal private jet. Jeffree posts about his private jet all the time, on Instagram and even took to twitter earlier this year to offer a ride in his private jet to Ru <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul’s Drag Race</a> star, The Only Detox.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=donald-trump>Donald Trump</h2><p><a href=#>Donald Trump</a> is quite possibly the most controversial person on earth at the moment. Almost everything he says can be turned into a debate. The one thing we can’t debate on is how much he’s worth. Despite being the current president of The United States of America, he was always known for his business prospects.</p><p>His <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Boeing 757-200</a> is the definition of luxury. With his name largely printed on the side of the aircraft, there’s no questioning this jet is his. Trump’s nearly $100 million private jet is completely customized and the priciest one mentioned so far.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Most Expensive Private Jets</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8Keo56aop7BqrHSZqawpl2lv6rCwK2cZqKVqcBurcirZJ2qkaCybrfYpaCeZZqau6%2Bx0Wg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcelebrities-own-private-jets-air-drake-kylie-jenner.html&text=10%20Celebrities%20That%20Own%20Private%20Jets&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcelebrities-own-private-jets-air-drake-kylie-jenner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcelebrities-own-private-jets-air-drake-kylie-jenner.html&title=10%20Celebrities%20That%20Own%20Private%20Jets" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcelebrities-own-private-jets-air-drake-kylie-jenner.html&title=10%20Celebrities%20That%20Own%20Private%20Jets" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcelebrities-own-private-jets-air-drake-kylie-jenner.html&title=10%20Celebrities%20That%20Own%20Private%20Jets" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcelebrities-own-private-jets-air-drake-kylie-jenner.html&description=10%20Celebrities%20That%20Own%20Private%20Jets" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10-facts-about-the-new-magic-mike-xxl-movie.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Facts About The New Magic Mike XXL Movie">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./real-housewives-ultimate-girls-trip-season-3-what-to-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Real Housewives: Ultimate Girls Trip' Season 3: What to Know">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
