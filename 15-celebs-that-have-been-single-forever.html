That means that the entire world knows most of the intimate details of their private lives. Some celebs go to great lengths to keep their private life just that, private.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But in the world we live in today people demand news and gossip on the stars they watch in movies and on television. Why this is, is completely beyond me. But that’s the way it is. A lot of celebs don’t mind the attention and it gives the media plenty to write about all the time.</p><p>Some people in the spotlight go from relationship to relationship. Keeping up with who they are currently linked to romantically is sometimes a very hard thing to do. Then there are those that just stay single for long amounts of time. That usually leads to a lot of rumors because some people don’t have anything better to write about, and let’s face it, people read it. If they didn’t read it, it wouldn’t be written.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are many reasons that celebs don’t get married or remain single for long amounts of time. Maybe they don’t want the public scrutiny, maybe they just don’t believe in marriage or maybe they just want to keep the money they have. Here we will take a look at 15 celebs that have been single forever. While some have been married before, they may have also come out and talked about just how bad of a decision that was. Other celebrities, such as Bill Maher, have been open about&nbsp;their disdain towards marriage in the past, and you can believe those people are covered too. Either way, I’ll bet you will learn a few things about your favorite people that you didn’t know before!</p><h2 id=15-betty-white><strong>15. </strong><strong>Betty White</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Betty White</a> is one of the greatest and funniest actresses of all time. Even at the age of 94 she can still deliver a quick punch line like no other. She has won a Grammy, numerous Emmys and Screen Actors Guild Awards throughout her very long career that has spanned over 75 years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When she was young White married two times within a five year period. After being single for 14 years she married Allen Ludden in 1963 and they were together until he died in 1981. She has never remarried and she once spoke to <a href=#>Larry King</a> about it, saying&nbsp;"Once you've had the best, who needs the rest?"</p><p>Well said, Betty!</p><p></p><h2 id=14-chelsea-handler><strong>14. </strong><strong>Chelsea Handler</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Chelsea Handler</a> is definitely someone that people pay attention to. She has a certain sexiness about her and she is a very intelligent woman. The 41-year-old has carved out a nice career for herself as a comedian, writer, actress, producer and television host.</p><p>For seven years she had a show on E! network that was called Chelsea Lately and she currently hosts a new show on Netflix called Chelsea. In 2012, Time Magazine named her as one of the 100 Most Influential People.</p><p>She started dating Ted Harbert in 2006 but that ended in early 2010. By all reports it looks like she has been single since then. In 2012, she confirmed to More Magazine that she isn’t planning on getting married&nbsp;when she said&nbsp;"I don't know that I'm marriage material. I don't know if I would ever want to be someone's wife. It makes breaking up much more complicated."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=13-sheryl-crow><strong>13. Sheryl Crow</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Sheryl Crow</a> is one of the most successful female singers in history. She has sold more than 50 million albums around the world and she has won nine Grammy Awards. She has also performed with some of the best in the world. The Rolling Stones, <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a>, Stevie Nicks, <a href=#>Eric Clapton</a>, <a href=#>Prince</a> and <a href=#>Kid Rock</a> are just a few of those.</p><p>She is also a pretty good actress and has appeared on several television shows including 30 Rock, Cougar Town and One Tree Hill.</p><p>The 54-year-old is no stranger to high-profile relationships. She has been involved with <a href=#>Owen Wilson</a> and was once engaged to <a href=#>Lance Armstrong</a>. She has never been married and by all accounts, she has been single since ending things with Armstrong in 2006. See what you did Lance? Shame on you!</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-kristin-davis><strong>12. Kristin Davis</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kristin Davis</a> is the perfect example of someone that plays a role on television that is completely opposite of her own beliefs. She was on the show Sex and the City for six seasons playing Charlotte York. York was a woman that was obsessed with finding someone to marry, but in real life Davis has a much different view on the subject.</p><p>The now 51-year-old actress said that it’s not a priority in her life. She once said in an interview,&nbsp;"Little girls who say, 'I want to get married'; I was never one of those little girls. It is not that I wouldn't, but I don't see that I must do it or be unhappy. I don't know if I'll ever get married. I'm perfectly happy [with] my single self."</p><p>Currently, she isn’t linked to anyone romantically so it doesn’t look like her views will be changing anytime soon.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-stevie-nicks><strong>11. Stevie Nicks</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Stevie Nicks</a> was certainly a hottie back in the day. She sang with Fleetwood Mac for many years before embarking on a very successful solo career. Over her career she has put together over 40, Top 50 hit singles and she has sold over 140 million albums. Rolling Stone Magazine named her “The Reigning Queen of Rock and Roll” and named her as one of the “100 Greatest Singers of All Time”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She had a very close working relationship with <a href=#>Tom Petty</a> and the Heartbreakers for more than thirty years. They performed many times on her solo albums and they have gone out on tour together countless times. They collaborated on the song “Stop Draggin’ My Heart Around” and it became one of the biggest hits in the careers of both acts.</p><p>The 67-year-old Nicks was married for a short time in 1983. The details of the marriage are a little strange and it only lasted for a few months. She has never gotten married again and has no children. Over the years, she has been linked to <a href=#>Don Henley</a>, <a href=#>Lindsey Buckingham</a>, <a href=#>Mick Fleetwood</a> and <a href=#>Joe Walsh</a> among a few others. She said one time that Walsh was her greatest love but drug abuse by both of them made the relationship destined for failure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She said the reason for never marrying or having children of her own was because of her career. "My mission maybe wasn't to be a mom and a wife; maybe my particular mission was to write songs to make moms and wives feel better.”</p><p>As far children go Nicks said "I have lots of kids (niece, godchildren, etc.). It's much more fun to be the crazy auntie than it is to be the mom, anyway.”</p><p></p><h2 id=10-diane-keaton><strong>10. Diane Keaton</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Diane Keaton</a> has been in so many great movies that it’s impossible to list them all here. She hit the big time with her role in <i>The Godfather </i>and she won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her work in the 1977 film Annie Hall.</p><p>She went on to later stardom in the films Looking for<i> Mr. Goodbar, Reds, Father of the Bride </i>and <i>The First Wives Club</i> as well as several others.</p><p>Keaton is now 70 years old and she has never been married. She had very public relationships with <a href=#>Woody Allen</a>, <a href=#>Warren Beatty</a> and also with <a href=#>Al Pacino</a>. That’s a pretty impressive list. But as far as marriage goes it’s not for Keaton. She said,&nbsp;"I'm attracted to men, and I love playing around with them. But a life shared together? That's a different world. I think you have to be somebody who can compromise and be realistic. I could never do it. Ever."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At least she’s honest.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-susan-sarandon><strong>9. Susan Sarandon</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Susan Sarandon</a> is one of the most famous actresses that has ever been on the silver screen. Her film credits and awards are numerous. You know her from her roles in <i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Thelma & Louise, The Client and Dead Man Walking.</i></p><p>Sarandon has also been on several television shows such as<i> Friends </i>and <i>Malcolm in the Middle</i>.</p><p>In 1988, she was in the smash hit movie <i>Bull Durham</i> where she met <a href=#>Tim Robbins</a>. The pair began a relationship that lasted until 2009 but they never got married. Shortly after they split up she started seeing Jonathan Bricklin. They parted ways in 2015 and the 69-year-old actress has now been single for over a year.</p><p>After her and Robbins broke up she said&nbsp;"I've always liked the idea of choosing to be with somebody. I thought that if you didn't get married you wouldn't take each other for granted as easily. I don't know if after twenty-something years that was still true."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-bill-maher><strong>8. Bill Maher</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Bill Maher</a> has been all over television for many years now. He’s a comedian, political commentator, writer, actor, producer, TV host and media critic. Basically, if it’s on television Maher has done it. He has had a show on HBO for over ten years called <i>Real Time with Bill Maher</i> in which his main focus is politics. He is no stranger to controversy as he is never afraid to speak his mind on any subject. Nothing is off limits to him, including religion.</p><p>He was ranked #38 on Comedy Central’s list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time.</p><p>The 60-year-old Maher started dating Playboy Cyber Girl, Coco Johnsen in 2003. After a year and a half, she sued him because she stated that he promised to marry her and have kids with her. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed. Johnsen had accused a previous boyfriend of kidnapping and rape in 1997. Those charges we dismissed as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He said that he is the only one of his friends that has never gotten married.&nbsp;"I'm the last of my guy friends to have never gotten married, and their wives, they don't want them playing with me. I'm like the escaped slave—I bring news of freedom.”</p><p>He has had several short-term relationships and his stance on not wanting to get married isn’t going to lead to too many long-term pairings.</p><p>That being said, he last linked to Anjulie Persaud two years ago and there are no reports yet that it has ended, so maybe somebody was able to tame him?</p><p></p><h2 id=7-charlize-theron><strong>7. </strong><strong>Charlize Theron</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Charlize Theron</a> is a 40-year-old beauty that has been in several movies. Some of her most known work includes&nbsp;parts in Mad Max: Fury Road,<i>&nbsp;The Italian Job, Mighty Joe Young </i>and <i>The Devils Advocate.</i> Her role in the movie <i>Monster </i>won her a Screen Actors Guild Award, Golden Globe, Silver Bear and an Academy Award.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She dated <a href=#>Stephan Jenkins</a> (Third Eye Blind lead singer) for four years and then after nine years together she ended a relationship with Stuart Townsend in 2010. She went through four years of being single before hooking up with Sean Penn for about a year, but they broke up last summer. She has been single for about a year now and since 2010, Penn was her only relationship.</p><p>Her view on marriage? She said&nbsp;"Marriage was never something that was important to me. I don't know the exact reason for that. I really want for myself a long-term relationship and I have been in long-term relationships. That's the kind of union that I want. The actual ceremony is not something that is important to me, but I see the importance for other people."</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-al-pacino><strong>6. Al Pacino</strong></h2><p>76-year-old <a href=#>Al Pacino</a> is one of the best actors of our time (if not all time!) He has won an Academy Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, two Tony Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, one British Academy Film Award and numerous others. He is one of the few to win a competitive Oscar, An Emmy, and a Tony. That’s considered the Triple Crown of acting and it happens about as rarely as the Triple Crown in baseball is won. For context, Miguel Cabrera is the only baseball player to win it in the last 49 years.</p><p>You may know him from his roles in<i>&nbsp;The Godfather </i>(all three of them)<i>, Scarface, Dog Day Afternoon, Scent of a Woman</i> and<i> Dick Tracy.</i> He has been in so many great movies it’s impossible to name them all right here. But if you see the name Al Pacino in the credits of a flick, you can be assured that it’s going to be a good movie.</p><p>Pacino has never been married and it looks like he has been single since 2003 when his relationship with Beverly D’Angelo ended after seven years. He has had a few short term relationships but nothing that lasted very long.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1999 longtime friend Lawrence Grobel talked to People Magazine about Pacino and why he never married. He told them that&nbsp;"[Al's] father left when he was young. He doesn't want to get involved in a bad marriage. And he can be a difficult man sometimes, and I think he's aware of that. To unravel why Al has never married is like onions, there's layers and layers of stuff."</p><p></p><h2 id=5-kourtney-kardashian><strong>5. Kourtney Kardashian</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a> has had an off again on again relationship with <a href=#>Scott Disick</a> for about ten years but they never married. The 37-year-old Kardashian has yet to tie the knot with anyone so she can be considered officially single. Her relationship with Disick has been an odd one for sure. Over the course of their time together each one has had not so flattering things to say about each other in public. Yet every time you think it’s over, it’s not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kourtney is part of the famous Kardashian family. Nobody has ever really figured out what is so special about them. They really haven’t done anything noteworthy in the world but for some reason, people tune into their shows every single week in record numbers and that’s all that sponsors and networks care about. If people watch they will keep it on the air no matter how stupid it is.</p><p>Disick told <a href=#>Ryan Seacrest</a> once,&nbsp;"I think if it's not broke, don't fix it. I used to want to get married more than she did, and then, being that she was always so not interested, I've decided not to be."</p><p>Doesn’t that sound like a romantic, novel type relationship? No, I didn’t think so.</p><p>Last reports from E! News says that the couple split up about a year ago. So it looks like she has been single for about a year now, which by Kardashian standards is like ten years. She and Scott may have reconciled by now, but since I have better things to do in life, I don’t watch the show so I can’t say if the break up is still on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-jon-hamm><strong>4. Jon Hamm</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jon Hamm</a> is an actor that has found a lot of success on both televisions and on the silver screen. The 45-year-old is known for his roles in <i>Space Cowboys, Mad Men, Stolen, Parks and Recreation, Minions, Shrek Forever After </i>and<i> Bridesmaids.</i></p><p>He has won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series-Drama and he has also won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. Overall he has been nominated for 16 Primetime Emmy Awards.</p><p>Hamm spent 18 years with Jennifer Westfeldt before the relationship ended in late 2015. They never married so he could be considered officially single for all of those years. In a couple of interviews that he gave you could see the writing on the wall that the relationship wasn’t going to be a forever thing. In 2010, he told Parade, "I don't have the marriage chip, and neither of us has the greatest examples of marriages in our families. Jen is the love of my life, and we've already been together four times longer than my parents were married."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In another interview he said&nbsp;"We may not have a piece of paper that says we're husband and wife, but after 10 years, Jennifer is more than just a girlfriend. What we have is much deeper and we both know that. To me, people get married when they're ready to have kids, which I'm not ruling out.”</p><p>Well, it doesn’t look like that will be happening now, Jon, sorry. I think you can go ahead and rule it out.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-taylor-swift><strong>3. Taylor Swift</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> is a country singer that has reached levels of success only known by a few. Her songs “Our Song”, “Love Story”, “You Belong With Me” and “I Knew You Were Trouble” have been smash hits around the globe.</p><p>Her albums have all been huge successes and the 26-year-old stunner is the only female to win the Album of the Year Grammy Award two different times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Along with countless music awards that she has won, Swift has also appeared in the movies <i>The Giver</i> and <i>Valentine’s Day.</i> In 2015, Forbes Magazine made her the youngest woman to ever appear on the Forbes 100 Most Powerful Women list.</p><p>Swift has never married but has been linked romantically to several men since 2008. In 2013, she took a two-year break from dating and then for the last year she has been with record producer <a href=#>Calvin Harris</a>. The two-year break prior to that qualifies her for this list because for a celeb, 2 years is a very long time in the romance department.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-sandra-bullock><strong>2. Sandra Bullock</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Sandra Bullock</a> is sexy, smart, and extremely talented. The 51-year-old is one of the highest paid actresses in Hollywood and she has won an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. In 2015 People Magazine named her the Most Beautiful Woman, talk about an impressive resume.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the 90s she appeared in the movies <i>Speed, A Time to Kill</i> and<i> While You Were Sleeping</i>&nbsp;among others. More recently she has found success in the movies <i>Miss Congeniality, Crash, The Blind Side </i>and<i> Gravity </i>&nbsp;as well as several others. She voiced a role in the box office smash <i>Minions </i>and she made many appearances on TV’s George Lopez that aired on ABC.</p><p>Early in her career, Bullock had relationships with <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a>, <a href=#>Matthew McConaughey</a>, Tate Donovan and NFL quarterback <a href=#>Troy Aikman</a>. In 2005, she got married to motorcycle guru <a href=#>Jesse James</a>. That lasted until 2010 when it came out the James had been cheating on Bullock throughout the marriage, countless times. She remained single until just recently when she started dating Bryan Randall.</p><p>Give that a little thought. Jesse James was married to Sandra Bullock and he cheated on her countless times. What an idiot.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-tom-cruise><strong>1. Tom Cruise</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> is one of the best actors of our time. Though his movies are always hit or miss. If it’s good, it’s great and a box office smash. If it’s bad, it’s horrible and a box office failure. There is no in between. Luckily for his bank account, he has had more successes than failures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He has won three Golden Globe Awards and he made his movie debut in 1981 in the movie Endless Love where he starred with Brooke Shields. Not a bad way to make your debut at all. He is known for his roles in <i>Taps, Risky Business, Top Gun, The Color of Money, Cocktail</i> and<i> Rain Man.</i></p><p>His list of appearances in movies goes on and on. <i>A Few Good Men, The Firm, Jerry Maguire</i>, and the<i> Mission: Impossible</i>&nbsp;series have all seen him doing some of his best work on screen.</p><p>While the 53-year-old has seen a lot of on-screen success, the same can’t be said for him off screen. He has made a lot of controversial statements and appearances that haven’t always painted him as a high-quality member of society.</p><p>When he was a younger man he liked to play the field and had a taste for older women. He went through a lot of older women before he settled down with <a href=#>Mimi Rogers</a>, who was only 8 years older than him. That marriage didn’t last long and in 1990, he married <a href=#>Nicole Kidman</a>. They were married for 11 years before divorcing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Five years later Cruise married <a href=#>Katie Holmes</a> but less than six years later, in 2012, the marriage was over. He hasn’t been linked to anyone since then so it looks like he has been single for about four years now. Maybe he just decided that staying single will save him a TON of money!</p><p>SOURCES:&nbsp;<a href=#>popsugar.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqbV2Ysq2xwaxkraCRqXqprdWeZJudlaN6tLXNoKOeZZakv6bCxKtm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-celebs-that-have-been-single-forever.html&text=15%20Celebs%20That%20Have%20Been%20Single%20Forever&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-celebs-that-have-been-single-forever.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-celebs-that-have-been-single-forever.html&title=15%20Celebs%20That%20Have%20Been%20Single%20Forever" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-celebs-that-have-been-single-forever.html&title=15%20Celebs%20That%20Have%20Been%20Single%20Forever" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-celebs-that-have-been-single-forever.html&title=15%20Celebs%20That%20Have%20Been%20Single%20Forever" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-celebs-that-have-been-single-forever.html&description=15%20Celebs%20That%20Have%20Been%20Single%20Forever" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-walking-deads-danai-gurira.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Things You Didn't Know About The Walking Dead's Danai Gurira">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./14-celebs-who-love-billie-eilish-6-who-stay-away.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="14 Celebs Who Love Billie Eilish (6 Who Stay Away)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
