Women went crazy for the shiny abs and dancing moves of <a href=#>Channing Tatum</a> and <a href=#>Matthew McConaughey</a>. Since then it was speculated that there might be a second installment of the now famously known movie. Many said that there was not much of a story-line, but that did not stop viewers of all ages from flocking to the theater and squawking with joy at the excitement of what they saw on screen. Based off of the life experience of Channing Tatum himself, fans can get an inside look on what it can be like for a male dancer or stripper who lives on the southern east coast tip of the U.S.. This time around the ride will take you a little further up the coast on a trip with the original dancers as well as a few other additional characters. Magic Mike XXL is sure to entertain with great dances, good characters, beautiful settings and of course beautiful men. This franchise is sure to soar in popularity again this summer and shows no signs of slowing down. Before the movie hits the big screen there are a few facts we bet you didn't know about&nbsp;Magic Mike XXL.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>*Warning this article contains spoilers.*</p><h2 id=10-the-addition-of-twitch-amber-heard-jada-pinkett-smith-and-michael-strahan><strong>10. The Addition of Twitch, Amber Heard, Jada Pinkett Smith and Michael Strahan</strong></h2><p>Source: www.usmagazine.com, www.dailymail.co.uk, www.screenrant.com, www.magicmikemovie.com</p><p>Many will be excited and surprised to know of some of the cast additions to the second installment of Magic Mike. Jada Pinkett Smith, wife of Will Smith will play the owner of a strip club that the dancers of the film will be "entertaining in". Her role should be of great interest since the part was first intended to be played by a male actor. Amber Heard's role is a bit less known, but it seems that she will play a flirtatious girl named Raquel, whom has a moment of connection with Magic Mike. Well known hip hop dancer "Twitch" is also a newcomer to the set, and is cast of course as an additional dancer with the rest of the talented entertainment crew. Michael Strahan, co-host of the "Live with Kelly and Michael" morning show, will also be stripping down to show his "magic assets".&nbsp;All of these actors coming together will surely make for a great film.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-comes-to-theatres-july-1st><strong>9. &nbsp;Comes to Theatres July 1st!&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Source: www.magicmikemovie.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The hype for this movie continues to build as&nbsp;July 1st comes even closer with each week. The Magic Mike Instagram, Twitter and Facebook are all a buzz with weekly updates and posts showing their fans snippets of new information regarding the new movie. Many Magic Mike followers have been eagerly awaiting the sequel since the first ended. Some super excited fans may be able to purchase tickets much earlier than the July 1st. date. In select large cities some fans could be lucky enough to score their tickets weeks ahead of time. Of course this movie gets a rating of R, for "strong sexual content", suggestive language and drug use. This is not a family movie. Most will run to the movie with a friend while others may wish to go for a fun date night. In any case this movie will surely be one of the many blockbusters for this summer.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-manscaping-gone-wild><strong>8. &nbsp;Manscaping Gone Wild</strong></h2><p>www.magicmikemovie.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While on Ellen, Twitch, known for his dancing on "So You Think You Can Dance" and now Ellen's part time personal DJ, talked about his need to "manscape" for the filming of the movie. He was nervous about so much plucking and pulling in order to ensure a smooth physique. Apparently all of the men on the set of Magic Mike, who shake a tail, had to do the same in order to obtain the perfect "Magic Mike Look". Twitch had his waxing done while holding Ellen's hand on the set of her show. He apparently had to be waxed from head to toe. &nbsp;He was unaware of the show's prerequisite before signing on, but it of course did not stop him from participating in the filming of the movie.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-what-s-the-story-line-this-time-around><strong>7. What's the story line this time around?</strong></h2><p>www.myrtlebeachonline.com</p><p>If you are a fan of Magic Mike then you know that the last movie ended with Mike giving up the strip scene and landing in the arms of his romantic interest. Then how does he find his way back to the stage with the other dancers we love to watch? Well they all inevitably decide to give up earning their dollar bills while dancing but not before they go on the road. These magic dancers head up the coast from Florida to Savannah, Georgia and &nbsp;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to attend a stripper convention. Their goal is to end their "dancing career" on a high and "go out with a bang".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-scene-locations><strong>6. &nbsp;Scene Locations</strong></h2><p>Source: www.myrtlebeachonline.com</p><p>The public often wonders what it would be like to attend a filming on the set of their favorite upcoming movie. For some Magic Mike fans this was a reality. Many locals and vacationers were able to score some cash and even a few great pictures of the stars while portraying a day at Myrtle Beach on the 4th of July. While it was August, the point in the movie that they were filming was on the 4th. Therefore those in town on the set area and sidelines were asked to wear and dress patriotic.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-there-were-many-opportunities-to-be-an-extra-on-the-set><strong>5. There were many opportunities to be an extra on the set</strong></h2><p>Source: www.myrtlebeachonline.com</p><p>Most people would do anything to be near a movie set with famous attractive men. Women were eager to be an extra for this movie. There was a Facebook page to follow in order to get access to the latest information on where to be and how to get cast as an extra on the set of Magic Mike XXL. Their filming in Georgia and Myrtle Beach caused quite the excitement as many extras filled the streets. Some of them were even paid up to $300 a day to be included in the background of some of the scenes. What a great job, to be just hanging out around super stars on the set of a movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-matthew-mcconaughey-is-not-a-part-of-the-sequel><strong>4. Matthew McConaughey is not a part of the sequel</strong></h2><p>Source: www.usmagazine.com</p><p>Even though he was a big part of the first film, rumor has it that McConaughey will not be returning for the second film. According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Dish Nation</a>,&nbsp;when co-star Gabriel Iglesias was asked about McConaughey's&nbsp;return, he had this to say "Word has it that Matthew’s probably not gonna be involved in this one because he’s worth a lot of money." Other sources have noted that he wasn't able to return due to scheduling conflicts.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-the-boys-go-to-a-stripper-convention><strong>3. &nbsp;The Boys Go To A Stripper Convention&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Source: Channing Tatum Facebook Photo</p><p>Did you know that <a href=#>Channing Tatum</a>&nbsp;and the boys go to a stripper convention in this film? Not only do they go to one, but this idea is from Tatum's real life experience. At the age of 19, Tatum attending a stripper convention, an experience in which he wanted to include in the first film, but his producing partner thought that story was an entire movie in itself. Who would have thought that we would be watching a film about Tatum's younger years.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-new-love-interest-for-magic-mike><strong>2. New Love Interest for Magic Mike?</strong></h2><p>Source: www.popsugar.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It looks like the second movie will begin three years after the last one ended. This makes a lot of sense since it has been three years since the first Magic Mike was released. Not only will Matthew McConaughey be gone, but the previous love interest of Michael, Cody Horn&nbsp;who played "Brooke" and her little brother Alex Pettyfer as&nbsp;"Adam" will be missing as well. Last year Horn told Vanity Fair&nbsp;“I’m not in it,” stating that there was no room in the sequel to include a girlfriend. She added&nbsp;“Of course I’m bummed, but we spent a lot of time talking about it, and I completely agree that it does not make sense to have Brooke in this movie.”</p><p></p><h2 id=1-elizabeth-banks-is-ecstatic-for-her-role-in-xxl><strong>1.Elizabeth Banks is ecstatic for her role in XXL</strong></h2><p>via;cosmopolitan.com</p><p>Not only are we excited to see Banks in the upcoming&nbsp;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2&nbsp;but this star will also be making an appearance in the upcoming sequel. Banks is&nbsp;a huge fan of the film and&nbsp;has also stated that she is thankful for Tatum's dance to the song Pony as well as Joe Manganiello's "acrobatic stripper moves," according to Cosmo magazine. When asked about her role in the film, Banks responded&nbsp;"They're on a road trip, they're headed to the convention, and I basically run the convention. It's my convention. I'm the boss."
