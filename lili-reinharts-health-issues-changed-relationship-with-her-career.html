Besides her starring role in Riverdale, she has appeared in several interesting movies, published a book of poetry called "Swimming Lessons," and will star in the TV series Hal & Harper alongside Mark Ruffalo. But the start of her acting career was very difficult, and she has <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">suffered from depression</a> </strong>ever since she began her career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lili-reinhart-at-milan-fashion-week-springsummer-2023-max-mara.jpg><p>According to People, Reinhart began living in Los Angeles at 18, but she didn't find any success at the time. She explained that she wanted to stay in bed because she had a hard time meeting people, getting roles, and making money. Since she had been told that she struggled with depression several years earlier when she was 14 years old, it sounds like things got even worse when she was 18. After living once again in her hometown in Ohio, she learned that she would play Betty Cooper in Riverdale.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lili-reinhart-and-jack-martin-keep-their-relationship-out-of-the-public-eye-here-s-the-real-reason-why.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Real Reason Lili Reinhart And Boyfriend Jack Martin Keep Their Relationship Out Of The Public Eye</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Fans are curious about the real reason that Riverdale's Lili Reinhart and Jack Martin have kept their secretive relationship under wraps...</span><p>Lili Reinhart's TV Roles</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li>Leah in one episode of Scientastic!

She said:</p><p>"Some days I feel really defeated by my depression. "It's an exhausting battle that I've been fighting for 11 years and some days, like today, it can feel intolerable."</p><p>She continued:</p><p>"This is a reminder to my fellow warriors that it's okay to have days where you don't want to fight anymore. You don't need to justify your mental health to anyone."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Lili Reinhart felt depressed and anxious in junior high and high school, long before her Hollywood career began, it sounds like she learned some helpful coping tools that she has used ever since. In a 2017 interview with Self, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reinhart shared her mental health journey</a> and explained that she had <strong>panic attacks in grade eight</strong>. After taking medication for her anxiety and going to therapy, she began feeling better.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/riverdale-cast.jpg><p>The actress is honest about the fact that she has had depression for several years and that this isn't something that just goes away.

Although it would make sense if some actors wanted to focus on their sitcom or TV drama roles and wait to star in films until after the show was over, Reinhart starred in several movies during <strong>Riverdale's seven-season run from 2017 to 2023</strong>.</p><h2 id=lili-reinhart-shared-in-january-2024-that-she-has-alopecia>Lili Reinhart Shared In January 2024 That She Has Alopecia</h2><p>In January 2024, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lili Reinhart said that she has <strong>alopecia</strong></a>, which happened because of her depression.

While she might not be filming anything currently, alopecia might become a concern if it continues to happen when she's shooting her next project. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Reinhart's next TV show, Hal & Harper</strong></a>, was announced in August 2023 by Deadline.

It's also like, ‘But what a perfect opportunity to take control of what's going on inside.’ I feel very grateful because, without this time, I would have just kept trucking along.
