Some celebs will go to great lengths to maintain a youthful glow, as the young starlets are always ready to pounce and steal their thunder. While men don’t have the same pressures, the ladies are often judged heavily&nbsp;on their looks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of these leading ladies look fantastic, not only for their age, but in general. As women in the spotlight, they are constantly under scrutiny, so it is no surprise that they do all they can to&nbsp;look young and beautiful.</p><p>Actress Sofia Vergara is one example of a woman in her 40s who looks far younger than her age, but she is by far not the only one. Here are a group of talented and successful women who have the appearance of 20- and 30-somethings, but they are all years older. See their pretty pics as well as their beauty secrets to learn how they maintain their youthful glow. It’s not as hard as you may think to shave off those years.</p><p>Sure, these babes were blessed in the looks department from the get-go, but with some added help, they look even better. Aging gracefully is nice, but if these gorgeous gals want to put off the process a while longer, who’s to stop them?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Check out these pics and you won’t believe these women aren’t younger than what it says on their birth certificates. But now, their beauty secrets are out and we want to be in the know.</p><h2 id=sofia-vergara-spends-up-to-475-on-a-cream><strong>Sofia Vergara Spends Up To $475 On A Cream</strong></h2><p>At 45 years old, the Colombian beauty Sofia Vergara looks better than most women half her age. Her youthful glow and sultry&nbsp;foxiness&nbsp;oozes out of her every pore, making us wonder what she does to stay so mind-bogglingly gorgeous. Her trick to flawless, wrinkle-free skin? Crème de la Mer anti-aging cream, as she told Redbook magazine. As you might expect, this stuff ain’t cheap. It’ll cost&nbsp;you&nbsp;anywhere between $170 and $475 a jar. But for a well-to-do actress like Vergara, that’s pocket change. Plus, money is no object when the end results are so fab. Save up and invest in a jar. You may not land Joe Manganiello, but you’ll like what you see in the mirror.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=halle-berry-doesn-t-wear-makeup-when-she-doesn-t-have-to><strong>Halle Berry Doesn't Wear Makeup When She Doesn't Have To&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The fact that actress Halle Berry is 51 is astounding, as she looks more youthful with each passing year. Her beauty is timeless, and her looks are admired by fans far and wide. But how does she manage to stay so young-looking? It’s all about the moisturizing. She has been moisturizing morning and night since she has been in her 20s. And boy has all that hydration paid off. Berry is smooth and supple, proving that dry skin can be tamed and improved with some TLC on the regular. Plus, when she is not working, she tries to wear little to no makeup. Letting her beautiful skin breathe is the key to keeping it fresh and fantastic.</p><h2 id=gwen-stefani-stays-out-of-the-sun><strong>Gwen Stefani Stays Out Of The Sun</strong></h2><p>Singer Gwen Stefani is young at heart, but she is probably older than you think. Can you believe she is 48? Her man Blake Shelton doesn’t mind dating an older lady, especially one as hot as Stefani. But what’s her trick to keeping that young-looking beauty? Aside from her signature bold red lip, Stefani tries her best to stay out of the sun. A golden glow looks nice, but the aftermath can lead to wrinkles, dark spots, and leathery skin. With Stefani’s porcelain skin tone, she’s smart to avoid those damaging UVAs. Who needs a tan when you look as glam as Gwen anyway?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gabrielle-union-drinks-a-gallon-of-water-a-day><strong>Gabrielle Union Drinks A Gallon Of Water A Day</strong></h2><p>Actress Gabrielle Union is 45 years old, but by looking at her, you would never guess her age by a long shot. Her dewy skin is youthful, and her pretty face could pass for that of a 30-year-old, or even younger. Aside from good genes, Union swears by staying hydrated. She told Essence magazine that she can down a gallon of water a day, and it makes a big difference in the health and appearance of her skin, hair, and nails. Seems easy enough. But it’ll take more than tap water for most of us to look even half as good as Gabby.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez-gets-8-hours-of-sleep><strong>Jennifer Lopez Gets 8 Hours Of Sleep</strong></h2><p>J. Lo is 48 years old, but by the way she can shake it onstage, it is always a shocker when we hear her age. Not to mention, her face is flawless, leading us to believe she must hold the secret to eternal youth. While A-Rod may have something to do with that glow, Lopez is a big believer in the power of sleep. She claims to get at least eight hours a night, and with her hectic schedule plus two kids, that is quite a feat. All that slumber is worth it though&nbsp;— just look how fantastic she looks. Lopez meditates too, so all that “zen” must be why she is stress- and wrinkle-free.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-keeps-her-makeup-simple><strong>Jennifer Aniston Keeps Her Makeup Simple</strong></h2><p>Everyone’s favorite Friends&nbsp;actress Jennifer Aniston is the quintessential California girl, and at 48, she has never looked better. She always looks youthful and carefree, and even though she is pushing 50, she could pass for a woman decades younger. One of her simple beauty tricks is the “less is more” policy when it comes to wearing makeup. She never piles on the makeup, opting for a fresher, more natural face instead. She lets her inner beauty shine through, and boy does she have plenty of it. Why mess with a good thing? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!</p><h2 id=faith-hill-always-moisturizes><strong>Faith Hill Always Moisturizes&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Believe it or not, but the blonde and beautiful country darling, Faith Hill is a nifty 50. She looks like a million bucks and far younger than her age, but that’s part of what makes Hill such a thrill! She is naturally magnificent, but one way she keeps that youthful glow is by getting facials every now and then, particularly before big events like awards shows and concerts. Her facials surely work wonders, as Hill always looks fresh and flawless. She always moisturizes too, something that we can all do as well, yet something tells us we won’t look in the mirror and see Hill’s doppelgänger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nene-leakes-is-all-about-dove><strong>NeNe Leakes Is All About Dove</strong></h2><p>If you are a Real Housewives fan, then you must know the outspoken NeNe Leakes from the Atlanta franchise of the popular Bravo show. Leakes is 50 years old, but she looks far younger. Love her or hate her, you can’t deny that the woman looks good. Her skin is dewy and smooth, and she has a youthful energy to match. Her secret is quite simple&nbsp;— Dove soap. Nothing fancy or frilly, this gal relies on the basics to get that supple and&nbsp;foxy glow. She washes off her makeup every night with the drugstore soap, moisturizes, and she’s good to go. For all those celebs spending a fortune to look younger, they could save their cash and follow in Leakes’ footsteps.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christina-aguilera-splurges-on-cl-de-peau-beaut><strong>Christina Aguilera Splurges On&nbsp;Clé De Peau Beauté</strong></h2><p>She has been on the scene since she was a teen, but these days, pop sensation Christina Aguilera is 37 years old, but you’d never guess it if you didn’t know. The talented beauty looks quite young, and she can thank one special (and expensive) product for her smooth and wrinkle-free face. Clé de Peau Hydrating Cream is her go-to splurge, and a splurge it is indeed. One measly ounce costs a whopping $525, so this is no run-of-the-mill beauty product. But if you had the loot, you’d probably get a dose of this miracle cream, too, especially seeing how great Aguilera looks!</p><h2 id=jennifer-garner-uses-neutrogena-sunscreen><strong>Jennifer Garner Uses&nbsp;Neutrogena Sunscreen</strong></h2><p>The 45-year-old actress and mom of three, Jennifer Garner has always had that girl-next-door charm, but with her youthful looks, even in her mid-40s she looks girlish. Garner’s sunny glow and bright light makes her look much younger than her 45 years, but what’s the beauty’s secret? SPF all the way for this protective pretty lady. She shields her skin from the sun’s rays by wearing SPF, even under her makeup, although she doesn’t wear much makeup when she’s not on set. She loves a non-greasy sunscreen that absorbs right into the skin, especially Neutrogena. Whatever she is doing is working, because this lovely lady has never looked better.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alyssa-milano-eats-organic><strong>Alyssa Milano Eats Organic&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Fans have adored the gorgeous actress Alyssa Milano since she was a kid on Who’s the Boss, but these days, she is a 45-year-old grown woman. But just because she is 45 doesn’t mean she needs to look her age. Milano looks youthful and refreshed thanks to her skin secret — she eats organic. And when she can’t find an organic option, she still manages to maintain a healthy diet. She loves tomatoes, papaya, avocado, and garlic, all foods that are great for the body and skin. No GMOs for this gal. If eating well is the key to the fountain of youth, let’s all take a bite out of life!</p><h2 id=claire-danes-uses-latisse-lash-amplifier><strong>Claire Danes Uses LATISSE Lash Amplifier</strong></h2><p>Actress Claire Danes is 38 years old, but her youthful looks have us all fooled into thinking she’s 30 at best. Fans love the Homeland star not only for her talent, but for her magical on-screen presence. She has a natural look that is young looking and refreshed, thanks in part to her long and lush lashes. What’s her secret? Latisse, a prescription lash amplifier. The product claims to make lashes grow, and nothing is&nbsp;foxier than thick, long lashes to frame a set of gorgeous eyes like Danes’. Bat those lashes girl, and we will be sure to keep our eyes on you!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian-uses-a-silky-pillow-case><strong>Kourtney Kardashian Uses A Silky Pillow Case&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The eldest of the Kardashian sisters, Kourtney Kardashian, is 38 years old, but she looks super young thanks to the way she carefully cares for her body and skin. Sure, she has plenty of money to spend on the finest products (and perhaps plastic surgery), but her special secret to looking so young comes in the form of a pillowcase. A silk one, that is. She uses the Beauty Pillow which is not only made of silk, but it props your head up too, so you don’t wake up with lined and wrinkled skin after sleeping on one side all night. Sweet dreams indeed!</p><h2 id=megyn-kelly-uses-a-self-tanner-and-bronzer><strong>Megyn Kelly Uses A Self Tanner And Bronzer&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Morning television show host, 47-year-old Megyn Kelly is front and center early in the morning, so looking fresh is a must for this media mama. She always looks TV-ready and far younger than her age. She claims to use self-tanner, as well as foundation, concealer, and bronzer. So perhaps Kelly doesn’t do things the natural way, but if makeup makes her look and feel her best, then why not make the most of it? Nearly every woman (and some men) who are on the small screen swear by makeup, so why shouldn’t Kelly admit that she loves the coverage as she’s covering top stories?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=naomi-campbell-avoids-sugar><strong>Naomi Campbell Avoids Sugar</strong></h2><p>Naomi Campbell is one of the most famous supermodels to ever strut her stuff down the catwalk. And at 47 years old, she still looks as hot as the new up-and-comers taking over the fashion scene. Campbell is drop-dead gorgeous and looks far younger than her 47 years. She has great genes&nbsp;— that’s a given&nbsp;— but how else does she maintain her youthful and beautiful looks? One trick is to avoid sugar. She stays away from the sweet stuff. She does drink plenty of water, something that keeps skin well hydrated. Campbell also uses serums, under-eye creams, and moisturizers. If that’s all it takes to look so fabulous, then Campbell’s got it easy to remain so easy on the eyes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaGXnXqttcWeZmpsXZy8s7PEqKysZZOauaau0mauoaddqsCmecGemK6sqWK9s7vDrpqtq12pvG6%2F05qwZrGfqruoecuiop5lo6Szqq2Mr5yrn5GnrnA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f14-gorgeous-celebs-who-use-beauty-products-to-stay-young-like-sofia-vergara.html&text=14%20Over-40%20Celebs%20Who%20Use%20Beauty%20Products%20To%20Look%20Young%20Like%20Sofia%20Vergara&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f14-gorgeous-celebs-who-use-beauty-products-to-stay-young-like-sofia-vergara.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f14-gorgeous-celebs-who-use-beauty-products-to-stay-young-like-sofia-vergara.html&title=14%20Over-40%20Celebs%20Who%20Use%20Beauty%20Products%20To%20Look%20Young%20Like%20Sofia%20Vergara" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f14-gorgeous-celebs-who-use-beauty-products-to-stay-young-like-sofia-vergara.html&title=14%20Over-40%20Celebs%20Who%20Use%20Beauty%20Products%20To%20Look%20Young%20Like%20Sofia%20Vergara" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f14-gorgeous-celebs-who-use-beauty-products-to-stay-young-like-sofia-vergara.html&title=14%20Over-40%20Celebs%20Who%20Use%20Beauty%20Products%20To%20Look%20Young%20Like%20Sofia%20Vergara" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f14-gorgeous-celebs-who-use-beauty-products-to-stay-young-like-sofia-vergara.html&description=14%20Over-40%20Celebs%20Who%20Use%20Beauty%20Products%20To%20Look%20Young%20Like%20Sofia%20Vergara" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-questions-all-guys-are-too-afraid-to-ask-girls-and-the-answers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Questions All Guys Are Too Afraid To Ask Girls (And The Answers!)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./january-jones-birth-certificate-baby-daddy-father-mystery-xander-dane-jones.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                              January Jones Birth Certificate -- I STILL Won't Name the FATHER!
