Others feel as if these athletes' lofty pay-checks are justified due to the risk of injury and future complications associated with the “wear-and-tear” that comes with their job. For example, many athletes have been faced with severe, season-ending injuries that keep them out of the game for extended periods of time. This raises situations where sports stars are being paid huge amounts to "heal" as opposed to actually playing their game. In leagues where so much emphasis is placed on winning, serious injuries to key players can sometimes mean the difference between becoming champions and losing it all. Either way, injuries have become an important factor in professional sports and something that most players will have to deal with over the course of their career.&nbsp;With these factors in mind, here are ten of the highest-earning sports players to lose their season due to an injury:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-brien-taylor---1-55-million-per-year><strong>10. Brien Taylor - $1.55 Million Per Year</strong></h2><p>Picked first overall by the New York Yankees in 1991, Brien Taylor signed a contract for $1.55 million. Taylor had his career shortened when he dislocated his shoulder and tore his labrum in a fistfight, an arm injury that prevented him from ever playing a major league game. Currently, Brien Taylor is incarcerated for charges of distributing crack-cocaine and is serving a 38-month sentence. After his prison time is served, Taylor will face 3 years of supervised probation.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-ed-mccaffrey---1-6-million-per-year><strong>9. Ed McCaffrey - $1.6 Million Per Year</strong></h2><p>Having played in the NFL for the New York Giants, San Francisco 49ers and Denver Broncos, Ed McCaffrey is a three-time Super Bowl winner. On September 10th, 2001, McCaffrey suffered a season-ending leg-break while playing a Monday Night Football game against the New York Giants (his previous team). At the time, McCaffrey was earning an average of $1.6 million per season. Most recently, Ed McCaffrey replaced 850 KOA’s analyst Brian Griese.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-rashard-mendenhall---2-5-million-per-year><strong>8.

Sidney Crosby - $8.7 Million Per Year</strong></h2><p>In January 2011, the Pittsburgh Penguins announced that <a title="Sidney Crosby Net Worth" href=#>Sidney Crosby</a> would miss the remaining 42 games of the season due to do a concussion. In 2007 Sidney Crosby signed a five-year contracted worth $43.5 million; a base salary of $8.7 million per season. In the lockout-shortened 2013 season, Sidney Crosby was hit in the face with a puck which saw him sidelined for the last 12 games. Crosby returned for the playoffs but the Penguins were swept in 4 games by the Boston Bruins in the conference finals.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-adrian-peterson---14-9-million-per-year><strong>3. Adrian Peterson - $14.9 Million Per Year</strong></h2><p>As the star running back for the Minnesota Vikings in 2011, <a title="Adrian Peterson Net Worth" href=#>Adrian Peterson</a> tore the ACL in his left knee.
