Snoop is one of the most powerful and influential figures in hip-hop history, and despite his lovable-villain persona, his brilliance is not to be underestimated. The <a href=#>rapper who made fortune from his music</a> has sold approximately 12.5 million records in the United States alone and 37 million albums worldwide. After the release of his groundbreaking album Doggystyle in 1993, Snoop Dogg found himself at the top of the music world almost immediately. Here's a list of the Dogg father's top 10 highest-selling albums:</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a class=bc-title-link title="The 10 Strangest And Most Expensive Implants Of Hip-Hop Artists Ever" href=#>The 10 Strangest And Most Expensive Implants Of Hip-Hop Artists Ever</a></span></p><h2 id=the-best-of-snoop-dogg>The Best of Snoop Dogg</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2005, Snoop Dogg released his third greatest hits album, The Best of Snoop Dogg. These are largely hit singles, charted tracks, and fan favorites from his No Limit and Priority Records albums. In addition, the WWF Aggression compilation's Hell Yeah (Stone Cold Steve Austin Theme) and the Caught Up soundtrack's Ride On are included as bonus tracks. Snoop sold over 100,000 copies of the album.</p><h2 id=mac-amp-devin-go-to-high-school>Mac & Devin Go to High School</h2><p>Mac & Devin Go to High School is a soundtrack album recorded by <a href=#>American hip hop recording artists Snoop Dogg</a> and Wiz Khalifa for the film of the same name. The album's success is mainly due to its hit single Young, Wild & Free. In addition, music critics commended Snoop and Khalifa's technical rapping skills and the album's production. Snoop sold over 500,000 copies of the soundtrack, and in 2016, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) officially certified it as gold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-blue-carpet-treatment>The Blue Carpet Treatment</h2><p>The Blue Carpet Treatment is Snoop's eighth studio album. During its first week, it placed the album at position #5 on the US Billboard 200, with 264,000 copies sold. As soon as it was released, critics praised <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Blue Carpet Treatment</a> for its unique composition. IGN called it one of Snoop's strongest efforts in a long time, praising the album's rhythms, rhymes, and guests as it compliments Snoop himself. Sales for the album topped 715,000. With over 1 million copies sold in the United States, it was certified platinum in 2007.</p><h2 id=no-limit-top-dogg>No Limit Top Dogg</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Numerous reviewers praised No Limit Top Dogg, Snoop's fourth studio album, calling it a return to form and his best album since Doggystyle. Many appreciated the album's production, with <a href=#>American rapper Dr. Dre</a>'s tracks receiving special attention and Snoop's delivery also receiving high marks. Still, the album's length, the inclusion of No Limit features, and the absence of new lyrical content were common points of criticism. No Limit Top Dogg still debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200 with 187,000 in sales, with Ricky Martin's self-titled album taking the top spot. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RIAA has given the album</a> its highest possible rating: platinum (RIAA). The album has sold 2 million copies globally as of 2016, with 1.51 million of those sold in the United States as of March 2008.</p><h2 id=paid-tha-cost-to-be-da-boss>Paid Tha Cost to Be da Boss</h2><p>Snoop's sixth studio release, Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss, was released in 2002. The album opened at position No. 12 on the US Billboard 200 with initial sales of 174,000 copies. The album sold over 1.5 million copies, earning it a platinum certification from the RIAA.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tha-last-meal>Tha Last Meal</h2><p>Many people contributed to the album's production, including Dr. Dre, Timbaland, and Soopafly. The album was well received by critics, with many calling it his best work. With first-week sales of 397,000 copies, Tha Last Meal debuted at number nine on the US Billboard 200 chart, the week's biggest debut. It's Snoop Dogg's fifth album to debut in the top ten Billboard 200 in the United States.</p><p>For selling over 1.3 million copies in the United States, Tha Last Meal was awarded Platinum status by the RIAA in 2001. At the time of its release in March 2008, the album had sold 2.06 million copies in the United States, making the album the third best-selling album by Snoop Dogg in the country behind Doggystyle (1993) and Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told (1998).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=r-amp-g-rhythm-amp-gangsta-the-masterpiece>R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece</h2><p>Snoop Dogg's seventh studio album sold 225,000 copies in its first week, putting it at number six on the Billboard 200 chart. After peaking at number three on the Billboard 200 in its first week of release, the album dropped to number nine in its second week, selling 203,000 copies for a total of 428,000 in its first two weeks. It has sold 1,724,000 copies in the US as of March 2008. However, reports from the music press were uniformly enthusiastic about the album of the <a href=#>rapper who owns a lot of expensive cars</a>.</p><h2 id=da-game-is-to-be-sold-not-to-be-told>Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His third studio effort, Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told, was released in 2016. This is the first album by Snoop Dogg that does not feature any of his regular collaborators, including Dr. Dre, Nate Dogg, Warren G, and others. It is also in this album that Snoop Dogg officially changed his name from Snoop Doggy Dog. With initial sales of 520,000 copies, Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told debuted at #1 on the US Billboard 200 list.</p><p>The album marks Snoop Dogg's third straight US #1. Five weeks in a row, the album was a top ten seller on the Billboard 200. In October, the album was officially certified 2 Platinum. The album was the 39th best-selling album of the year in the United States, with 1.7 million copies sold as of November. It has sold over 2 million copies in the US since March 2008.</p><h2 id=tha-doggfather>Tha Doggfather</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His second album, Tha Doggfather, was released in 2004. Snoop spent 1995 preparing for his murder<a href=#> trial after being arrested </a>following the success of his debut album Doggystyle (1993). After being acquitted of all charges a few months after, he began recording his second album without Dr. Dre. Although it debuted at number one and sold 479,000 copies the week of November 12, 1996, it could not equal Doggystyle's success. Although it didn't break the record set by Doggystyle's 803,000 in its first week of sales, the album was the year's third-highest rap debut and fourth biggest debut overall, behind only Metallica's Load. The album garnered more than two million record copies in the US.</p><h2 id=doggystyle>Doggystyle</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Doggystyle was the album that started it all. After Snoop's essential contributions to Dr. Dre's 1992 solo debut, The Chronic, the two collaborated on the recording and production of this album. Doggystyle was a continuation of his West Coast hip-hop style, which he had begun developing with Dr. Dre's debut. Critics have appreciated the realism of Snoop Dogg's lyrics and his signature vocal cadence. Doggystyle was widely hailed as one of the best albums of the '90s and one of the best-selling hip-hop albums of all time, despite receiving some negative reviews upon its initial release.</p><p>Doggystyle was the fastest-selling hip-hop album of all time, and its first week of sales in the United States alone resulted in 806,858 purchases, both of which set new records for a beginning artist. Rolling Stone ranked Doggystyle as one of the Essential Recordings of the '90s, while The Source ranked it as one of the Best Rap Albums of all time. According to the Music Recording Industry Association of America, the album has achieved 4 Platinum status (RIAA). By 2015, the album had sold over 11 million copies globally and 7 million in the United States.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Numbers Don't Lie: The Highest-Grossing Albums Of Shakira, Ranked" href=#>Numbers Don't Lie: The Highest-Grossing Albums Of Shakira, Ranked</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Selling Albums</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Source</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMamdmoJmctaa%2F02aqnqScnruoecClma6lo2K8p3nSp6aoqF2ZvKizjKuYp6OVmXw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-10-highest-selling-albums-of-snoop-dogg-ranked.html&text=The%2010%20Highest-Selling%20Albums%20Of%20Snoop%20Dogg%2c%20Ranked&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-10-highest-selling-albums-of-snoop-dogg-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-highest-selling-albums-of-snoop-dogg-ranked.html&title=The%2010%20Highest-Selling%20Albums%20Of%20Snoop%20Dogg%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-10-highest-selling-albums-of-snoop-dogg-ranked.html&title=The%2010%20Highest-Selling%20Albums%20Of%20Snoop%20Dogg%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-highest-selling-albums-of-snoop-dogg-ranked.html&title=The%2010%20Highest-Selling%20Albums%20Of%20Snoop%20Dogg%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-10-highest-selling-albums-of-snoop-dogg-ranked.html&description=The%2010%20Highest-Selling%20Albums%20Of%20Snoop%20Dogg%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bravo-vanderpump-rules-cast-net-worth-ranked.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Cast Of Bravo's 'Vanderpump Rules' Ranked By Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-10-highest-grossing-jeff-goldblum-movies-ranked.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 10 Highest-Grossing Jeff Goldblum Movies, Ranked">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
