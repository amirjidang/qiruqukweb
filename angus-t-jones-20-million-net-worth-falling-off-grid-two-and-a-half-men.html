Jones is single, and enjoying life</strong>. He is photographed in Los Angeles from time to time. Jones is nearly unrecognizable from how he looked as a child. In his most recent sighting in August 2023, Jones stepped out barefoot with a long beard, glasses, black beanie, khaki shorts, and a black t-shirt that read "SHOQUIP," referring to his home state of Texas, on it.</p><p>There is not much information on Jones' current job or <a href=#>what he is doing now</a>, as Jones lives a very private life. However, Jones did come out of retirement in November 2023 to do a guest appearance on The Bookie as a favor to Chuck Lorre.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Jones is living off his $20 million and royalties from the show and seems healthy and happy</strong>.</p><p>Source: People, IMDb</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp5%2BlqHq1ecmopZ6rXWd9brnIpaOip55iu6bAjLCmq6yYYrOiuMuipaBln5uzbrPRoptmrKekeqK6w2aYZqCRobNuucSnZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fangus-t-jones-20-million-net-worth-falling-off-grid-two-and-a-half-men.html&text=Here%27s%20How%20Child%20Star%20Angus%20T.%20Jones%20Went%20From%20Having%20A%20%2420%20Million%20Net%20Worth%20To%20Falling%20Off%20The%20Gri&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fangus-t-jones-20-million-net-worth-falling-off-grid-two-and-a-half-men.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fangus-t-jones-20-million-net-worth-falling-off-grid-two-and-a-half-men.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Child%20Star%20Angus%20T.%20Jones%20Went%20From%20Having%20A%20%2420%20Million%20Net%20Worth%20To%20Falling%20Off%20The%20Gri" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fangus-t-jones-20-million-net-worth-falling-off-grid-two-and-a-half-men.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Child%20Star%20Angus%20T.%20Jones%20Went%20From%20Having%20A%20%2420%20Million%20Net%20Worth%20To%20Falling%20Off%20The%20Gri" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fangus-t-jones-20-million-net-worth-falling-off-grid-two-and-a-half-men.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Child%20Star%20Angus%20T.%20Jones%20Went%20From%20Having%20A%20%2420%20Million%20Net%20Worth%20To%20Falling%20Off%20The%20Gri" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fangus-t-jones-20-million-net-worth-falling-off-grid-two-and-a-half-men.html&description=Here%27s%20How%20Child%20Star%20Angus%20T.%20Jones%20Went%20From%20Having%20A%20%2420%20Million%20Net%20Worth%20To%20Falling%20Off%20The%20Gri" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./heres-what-the-cast-of-bring-it-on-has-done-since-the-films-release-kirsten-dunst-gabrielle-union.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's What The Cast Of 'Bring It On' Has Done Since The Film's Release">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./davine-joy-randolphs-net-worth-award-winning-holdovers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Has Da'Vine Joy Randolph's Net Worth Skyrocketed Following Her Award-Winning Holdovers Performance?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
