He charmed audiences in the sweet movies Finding Neverland and August Rush and has shown his range in recent years with the creepy TV thriller Bates Motel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While fans are curious about <a href=#>Freddie Highmore and Abigail Breslin's romance</a>, the young actor once had a relationship with another actress. Let's take a look at what we know about Freddie Highmore's first girlfriend, Sarah Bolger.</p><h2 id=sarah-39-s-career>Sarah's Career</h2><p>While <a href=#>Sons Of Anarchy could be confusing</a>, fans were excited to watch the spin-off Mayans, M.C., which began airing in 2018 and has had three seasons so far. It turns out that Freddie Highmore's very first girlfriend, Sarah Bolger, has been wowing fans with her role, Emily Thomas, on that show, and she's had a really wonderful acting career.</p><p>According to IMDb, Sarah Bolger was born in Dublin, Ireland, and has been working in Hollywood for a while now.</p><p>Sarah's career took off with the 2008 movie The Spiderwick Chronicles and from 2008 to 2010, the actress played Mary Tudor on the TV series The Tudors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other movie credits include 2011's The Moth Diaries, the 2011 TV movie Locke & Key, and 2015's The Lazarus Effect.</p><p>Sarah is also well-known for playing Princess Aurora in several episodes of the fantasy TV drama Once Upon A Time. Most recently, she has played Emily Thomas on the TV show Mayans M.C.</p><p>Sarah is now 30 years old and shares snapshots of her work along with selfies on her Instagram account. It's always interesting when someone begins acting as a child and then grows up while continuing this Hollywood career, and that's just what Sarah has done.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview about her Mayans M.C. role</a>, Sarah Bolger shared that her character is allowed to be character and strong and she really appreciates that. The actress said, "One of the wonderful things, even from the audition, is that these characters were not written as, 'Emily Thomas, girlfriend of,' 'Emily Thomas, wife of,' or 'Emily Thomas, love interest.' It was, 'Emily Thomas, power player.' These are women who are not necessarily attached to anyone. Their story points are their own, and that is incredible. That makes me so proud to be a part of this piece."</p><p>According to The Cinemaholic, Sarah attended Dublin's The Young People's Theater School and it looks like acting runs in the family as her sister Emma is an actress as well. Sarah's mom is described as a housewife and Sarah's dad works as a butcher.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Is ‘The Good Doctor’ Actor Freddie Highmore Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=freddie-and-sarah-39-s-love-story>Freddie And Sarah's Love Story</h2><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Freddie Highmore and Sarah Bolger played siblings</a> in The Spiderwick Chronicles, the couple dated while filming the movie. According to The Cinemaholic.com, they had been in a relationship prior to the movie shooting.</p><p>The publication notes that Freddie and Sarah's relationship began in 2006 and they broke up once filming wrapped for their movie. No one is really sure why they went their separate ways. Perhaps it was simply because they were very young at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with The Diva Review, Sarah Bolger shared that the cast would watch movies together and they made sure to see some that Mark Waters had directed since he was behind the camera on The Spiderwick Chronicles. Sarah explained, "We had movie nights on weekends. Montreal was fantastic, but there was little to do for people our age, so we go up to one another’s families and watch Mark’s movies. Just Like Heaven is one of our favorites."</p><p>Sarah also explained that she was a fan of the book series and wanted to star in the movie. She said, "I was very interested in the script after I read the books. I read them about a year and a half before I even heard this was being made into a movie. And I have to admit – maybe this was wishful thinking – but I honestly did think the illustration looks like me! (laughs) I swear to God, honestly, I was going around saying, “This could be me, right?'"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Miley Cyrus & Nick Jonas + Other Young Celebrity Couples We Totally Forgot About</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whenever Sarah Bolger talks about acting, she sounds very passionate about her craft and she has some awesome words of wisdom, too.</p><p>In an interview with IFTN's website, Sarah shared the way that she thinks about auditions. She gave some advice and said that before seeing the "sides" of the character that someone is trying out for, reading the entire script is always going to be a good idea. Sarah said that before thinking about this particular character, looking at the larger "world" of the movie or TV show is key.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Celeb Couples With The Same Zodiac Sign</a></span></p><p>While Freddie Highmore and Sarah Bolger haven't been together in years, it looks like Sarah might have found love again.
