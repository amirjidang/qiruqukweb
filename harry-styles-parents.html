He is proud to have won the 65th Annual Grammy for Album of the Year for “Harry’s House”.&nbsp;</p><p>His mother has been particularly inspirational for him as she introduced him to music when he was a young kid.&nbsp;</p><p>She used to play artists like Savage Garden, <a href=#>Shania Twain</a>, and Norah Jones which obviously impacted Harry’s own musical journey in life. In fact, Shania joined Harry on stage during Coachella 2022 and he was forever grateful for her part in those special memories.</p><p>Styles’ parents would no doubt be incredibly proud of all he has achieved with his career today, something that means the world to him.</p><p>Anne Twist, Harry Styles’s mother, was born on October 21, 1967. By profession, Twist is a former journalist who wrote for various newspapers and magazines in Northern England before retiring in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>Growing up in the town of Holmes Chapel with her mother and siblings, Anne developed a love for music from an early age. Her father was a local artist and she often went to his shows with her mother which exposed her to different sounds and genres of music.&nbsp;</p><p>From these experiences, she developed an appreciation for music that she would later share with Harry when he was young.</p><p>Desmond Styles, Harry Styles’s father, was born on June 12, 1964 in Redditch. Desmond had always been passionate about art but it wasn’t until he met Anne that he felt truly inspired to pursue his dreams further.&nbsp;</p><p>The two would go on to start their own <a href=#>business</a> called “Re-Style Design” where they provided interior design services as well as creating unique and bespoke furniture pieces. Despite their success they decided to leave the business behind so they could focus more time raising their <a href=#>family</a>.</p><p>The couple married in 1987 and two years later Anne gave birth to Harry Edward Styles on February 1st 1989.&nbsp;</p><p>As the oldest child of three (Harry has two younger sisters), it was clear from an early age that Harry had inherited some creative genes from his parents – this became evident when he joined a school band at only 8 years old!&nbsp;</p><p>Anne worked hard to nurture this passion by introducing him to artists like Savage Garden, Shania Twain and Norah Jones – all of whom greatly impacted the direction Harry wanted to take musically when he eventually became older.</p><p>At 14 years old Harry auditioned for The X Factor UK as part of boyband One Direction which landed him global fame & success that continues today – having sold over 70 million albums worldwide!&nbsp;</p><p>His parents were right there with him every step of the way offering advice & support throughout his journey – even joining him on stage during Coachella 2022 when Shania Twain was his special guest!&nbsp;</p><p>It’s no surprise then that in 2021 Harry won the 65th Annual Grammy award for Album Of The Year for ‘Harry’s House’ – something both Anne & Desmond must have beamed with pride at.</p><p>It wasn’t just good news for Harry either; being awarded Best Pop Vocal Album made it especially poignant for them as it surely reminded them of all those nights spent listening together growing up!&nbsp;</p><p>Though times have changed since then (his parents now live in Barbados) you can still feel how much love there is between all four family members today & how proud they are of all the milestones Harry has achieved thus far!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With such supportive parents it is clear why Harry has become one of the biggest stars in the world – something we’re sure will continue through many more incredible achievements yet to come!</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC0wKupsmWjqcatsdJmp5qqlaPBtHs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fharry-styles-parents.html&text=Who%20Are%20Harry%20Styles%20Parents%3f%20Inspiration%20Behind%20His%20Success&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fharry-styles-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fharry-styles-parents.html&title=Who%20Are%20Harry%20Styles%20Parents%3f%20Inspiration%20Behind%20His%20Success" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fharry-styles-parents.html&title=Who%20Are%20Harry%20Styles%20Parents%3f%20Inspiration%20Behind%20His%20Success" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fharry-styles-parents.html&title=Who%20Are%20Harry%20Styles%20Parents%3f%20Inspiration%20Behind%20His%20Success" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fharry-styles-parents.html&description=Who%20Are%20Harry%20Styles%20Parents%3f%20Inspiration%20Behind%20His%20Success" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./emily-bett-rickards.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Emily Bett Rickards dating?
