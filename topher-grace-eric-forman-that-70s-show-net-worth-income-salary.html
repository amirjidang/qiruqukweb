That '70s Show became so popular, fans are still obsessing over it years after its conclusion. The series also spawned a spinoff; That '90s Show is very different from the original, but had <a href=#>fans tuning in to see what it was all about</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while <a href=#>Danny Masterson obviously won't be returning for the series</a>, Topher Grace is. It's unclear how much he'll earn from the spinoff just yet, but Topher has already taken home millions thanks to That '70s Show. Here's how.</p><p><strong>Updated January 24th, 2023: </strong>This article has been updated to reflect new information about Topher Grace's projects, including That '90s Show, and his net worth.</p><h2 id=topher-grace-found-fame-on-that-39-70s-show>Topher Grace Found Fame On That '70s Show</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-clever-way-the-that-s-70s-show-creators-came-up-with-the-signature-360-circle-shot.jpg><p>In August 1998, the world was formally introduced to That '70s Show, and from that moment on, nothing was ever the same again. The period sitcom was just what television audiences were looking for, and it was able to catch lightning in a bottle while cruising to the top.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starring names like Topher Grace, Mila Kunis, and Ashton Kutcher, That '70s Show had a perfect cast that brilliantly brought each episode to life. At that point, Topher Grace was a complete and total unknown, and yet, he could not have done a better job while playing Eric on the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Did Laura Prepon Bash 'That '70s Show' Co-Star Topher Grace's Kissing Skills?">Did Laura Prepon Bash 'That '70s Show' Co-Star Topher Grace's Kissing Skills?</a></span></p><p>Grace was quite lucky to even get an audition in the first place, and he made the most of his golden opportunity.</p><p>Thanks to the show being a huge hit, it makes sense that he was pulling down a solid salary. What some don't know, however, is that the actor made millions from the show.</p><h2 id=topher-has-appeared-in-countless-films-and-tv-projects>Topher Has Appeared In Countless Films And TV Projects</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finding success on both the big and small screen is no easy feat, and yet, Topher Grace has successfully pulled this off during his time in entertainment. Yes, there is no denying that the actor is best known for his television work, but he has had success on the big screen, which helps tell the full story of his career.</p><p>In the world of film, Topher Grace has appeared in movies like Traffic, Ocean's Eleven, Mona Lisa Smile, Spider-Man 3, Valentine's Day, Predators, Interstellar, and BlacKkKlansmen. That is an undeniably impressive list of movies right there, and Grace still has more in the works.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Is Topher Grace On Good Terms With His That '70s Show Co-Stars?">Is Topher Grace On Good Terms With His That '70s Show Co-Stars?</a></span></p><p>On the small screen, everyone knows the big show he was part of, but the actor has been on other shows, too. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grace has been involved with shows</a> like King of the Hill, Robot Chicken, The Simpsons, The Muppets, Workaholics, Black Mirror, The Twilight Zone, and Home Economics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When talking about Grace's career, however, there is simply no way of overlooking the years he spent on That '70s Show.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-topher-grace-worth>How Much Is Topher Grace Worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/60BB4895-5D29-48C4-A273-76C16A249FBD.jpeg><p>So, how much was Topher Grace pulling down to star as Eric Foreman on That '70s Show? Thanks to the show being a huge success, Grace was able to make millions of dollars, and that's before syndication even kicked in.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Topher reportedly made about $300,000 per episode</a> in later seasons of the series; not a bad take-home in exchange for <a href=#>donning a wig and portraying Eric Forman</a>. Of course, earlier episodes weren't as pricey for the network, and the cast's salaries increased over time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eventually, Grace would depart the series early, and he was able to land some notable film roles that undoubtedly boosted his net worth.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Topher Grace Really Feels About The Allegations Against His That '70s Show Co-Star, Danny Masterson">How Topher Grace Really Feels About The Allegations Against His That '70s Show Co-Star, Danny Masterson</a></span></p><p>Years after the series that made him famous ended, the actor is sporting an impressive net worth of $14 million. We imagine that he is still making some serious money off of That '70s Show, and Grace himself has even talked about how the money from the series has changed his life and fueled his desire to work with true auteurs while being selective about his projects.</p><p>"For me, five or six years ago, I looked around at my life and I had just met the woman who is now my wife. I was feeling really confident and good, and it occurred to me that I was really lucky to have been on a sitcom for a lot of years. I realized then that I didn’t really need a lot more money," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor said in 2018</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, it wasn't as if That '70s Show was a terrible experience. After all, Grace was willing to return as Eric Forman for the new show. Given that That '90s Show is in its early days, it's unclear whether Topher's net worth will skyrocket thanks to another seven-season run, but money is definitely no issue for the actor these days.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKiYmr9us9Gamp5llae2pHnFqKmmmZ5iwamt02ZuaatdqLWww4ynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMoqWcp52aerSty5qpsmc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftopher-grace-eric-forman-that-70s-show-net-worth-income-salary.html&text=How%20Topher%20Grace%20Made%20Millions%20On%20That%20%2770s%20Show&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftopher-grace-eric-forman-that-70s-show-net-worth-income-salary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftopher-grace-eric-forman-that-70s-show-net-worth-income-salary.html&title=How%20Topher%20Grace%20Made%20Millions%20On%20That%20%2770s%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftopher-grace-eric-forman-that-70s-show-net-worth-income-salary.html&title=How%20Topher%20Grace%20Made%20Millions%20On%20That%20%2770s%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftopher-grace-eric-forman-that-70s-show-net-worth-income-salary.html&title=How%20Topher%20Grace%20Made%20Millions%20On%20That%20%2770s%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftopher-grace-eric-forman-that-70s-show-net-worth-income-salary.html&description=How%20Topher%20Grace%20Made%20Millions%20On%20That%20%2770s%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./inside-the-50-million-new-york-penthouse-designed-by-the-legendary-architect-zaha-hadid.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Inside The $50 million New York Penthouse Designed By The Legendary Architect Zaha Hadid">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hill-harper-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-374493-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hill Harper Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
