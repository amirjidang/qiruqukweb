However, some show no remorse whatsoever. It's no secret that celebrities make more money than the average Joe, but does that mean they have to spend it all in the most unpractical ways? They do throw away most of their money on huge mansions, expensive cars, and designer clothes. That's not even half of it. Some celebrities have become quite famous for their extravagant spending habits, acquiring plenty of ridiculously expensive things that prove completely useless. Why buy them? Because they can.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They tell you not to become too attached to material possessions because they are not what matter most in life. Apparently, nobody told this to the following celebrities. Some fancy exotic animals, others feel they need a ghost-busting machine to chase away bad spirits, some wear golden pants, others soak in solid gold bathtubs. They are not just useless, they are plain ridiculous. I mean, who in the world needs a Bengal tiger in their home? Let's have a look at the flashiest and most extravagant items and worldly possessions you can imagine and find out.</p><h2 id=13-lady-gaga---ghost-busting-gizmo-50-000><b>13.Lady Gaga - Ghost Busting Gizmo: $50,000</b></h2><p>“I ain't afraid of no ghost. If you're seeing things running through your head. Who can you call? Ghostbusters...” Apparently <a title="Lady Gaga Net Worth" href=#>Lady Gaga</a> is afraid and is seeing things. She dropped $50,000 on a ghost busting gizmo, some sort of an Electro-Magnetic Field Reader that keeps the ghosts away. She has been known to pay paranormal experts and ghost hunters to check her hotel rooms for evil spirits and other spiritual presences, in which case a ghost busting machine sounds like a good investment, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=12-beyonce---leggings-100-000><b>12. Beyonce - Leggings: $100,000</b></h2><p>While most of us buy their leggings from the nearest department store, <a title="Beyonce Net Worth" href=#>Beyonce</a> buys hers from Balenciaga. In case you didn't get it, she spends $100,000 for one pair of tights. However, they aren't your everyday pants, they are embellished in pure gold. That must be a happy pair of legs. Beyonce wore such a pair of Balenciaga golden leggings in 2007, when she performed on the stage of the BET Awards.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-mike-tyson---white-bengal-tigers-150-000><b>11. Mike Tyson - White Bengal Tigers: $150,000</b></h2><p>Remember <i>The Hangover</i>, when those guys woke up in the morning with no clue to what happened the previous night, and discovered a tiger in their bathroom? Soon after, <a title="Mike Tyson Net Worth" href=#>Mike Tyson</a> showed up to get his pet back. Well, that's not all fiction. Back in the day, Mike Tyson was worth $300 million. That's a lot of money to spend. When asked about his splurges, Mike Tyson himself admitted that “there was some dumb s**t.”. He bought two Bengal tigers for $150,000, and they were not cheap to take care of, running close to $4,000 a month.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=10-jay-z---75-bottles-of-bubbly-250-000><b>10. Jay Z - 75 Bottles of Bubbly: $250,000</b></h2><p>When <a title="Jay Z Net Worth" href=#>Jay Z</a> put an end to his contract with flamboyant champagne brand Cristal, he opted for Armand de Brignac, a ridiculously expensive luxury brand connoisseurs know as the “Ace of Spades.” While celebrating at Club Liv in Miami with his entourage, he bought 75 bottles of “Ace of Spades” champagne, dropping $250,000. Now, Jay Z holds the record for the most bottles popped in one night. What's really outrageous is the $50,000 tip he left. Those were some lucky bartenders.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-nicolas-cage---an-octopus-and-two-king-cobras-275-000><b>9.&nbsp;Nicolas&nbsp;Cage - An Octopus and Two King Cobras: $275,000</b></h2><p><a title="Nicolas Cage Net Worth" href=#>Nicolas Cage</a> is known for owning too many exotic pets. His most outrageous acquisitions in terms of animal friends were two extremely rare albino King Cobra snakes and an octopus, for which he paid $275,000. The King Cobra is the world's longest venomous snake. Nic called his Moby and Sheba. He also kept an antidote serum nearby at all times in case he got bitten. When the whole financial hell broke loose in 2007, he was forced to return his beloved pets to the zoo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-nicolas-cage---dinosaur-skull-276-000><b>8. Nicolas Cage - Dinosaur Skull: $276,000</b></h2><p>In 2007, Nicolas Cage spent $276,000 on a dinosaur skull. However, what's really funny is that he wasn't the only one interested in it. That's right, he had to fight for it. Nicolas Cage outbid fellow actor <a title="Leonardo DiCaprio Net Worth" href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> for the unusual collectible item. The lucky bidder brought home the 67 million year old dinosaur skull of a Tyrannosaurus bataar, a close cousin of the fearful T-Rex. However, it seems that all these ridiculous splurges are coming back to haunt him.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-paris-hilton---dog-house-325-000><b>7. Paris Hilton - Dog House: $325,000</b></h2><p>We have come to associate <a title="Paris Hilton Net Worth" href=#>Paris Hilton</a> with her miniature dogs she always carries around in her purse. I'm not sure whether they're actual living beings or just funny-looking toys, but apparently she loves them very much. What other reason could she have for buying a $325,000 dog house? Don't judge too soon. It's not your average dog house, it was custom-built and designed to reproduce her multi-million dollars mansion. What does her dogs' crib boast? Miniature designer furniture, air conditioning, heating, and even a chandelier. Those dogs are living better than most of us.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-rihanna---hairdos-1-million><b>6. Rihanna - Hairdos: $1 Million</b></h2><p>We all know <a title="Rihanna Net Worth" href=#>Rihanna</a> for her beautiful voice, but we also know her for her ever-changing style. Now she's brunette, now she's a redhead, long, short, curly, straight. Who can keep up with her? Ever wondered what it costs to keep her hair as joyful and playful? A jaw-dropping $1 million a year just for hairdos. That's 250 times more than what the average American spends on hair-care a year.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-nicolas-cage---comic-book-collection-1-6-million><b>5. Nicolas Cage - Comic Book Collection: $1.6 Million</b></h2><p>It's Nicolas Cage again, the most frivolous spender on our list. He bought a Bavarian castle, two yachts, a fleet of 50 exotic cars, two islands in the Bahamas, and a dozen mansions. Didn't anybody tell this guy when to stop? At least these were all acquisitions he could live in, drive in, or at least spend some quality time on. However, a comic book collection worth over $1 million? Of course, these all happened prior to his 2007 financial difficulties. After finding himself with a $13 million debt to the IRS, he sold his collection for $1.6 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-celine-dion---humidifier-2-million><b>4. Celine Dion - Humidifier: $2 Million</b></h2><p><a title="Celine Dion Net Worth" href=#>Celine Dion</a>'s marvelous voice is not easy to care for. The My Heart Will Go On singer and Vegas performer needs to train her vocal cords and pamper them in style if she wants to get the most out of them. In this case, a humidifier might seem a good investment, but to drop $2 million on one? Last time I saw a humidifier at my local depot it was a mere $20. What could possibly explain the price? Does it run on diamonds?</p><p></p><h2 id=3-mike-tyson---solid-gold-bathtub-2-3-million><b>3. Mike Tyson - Solid Gold Bathtub: $2.3 Million</b></h2><p>Is it any surprise that Mike Tyson made it on our list twice? The former boxer is universally known as a lavish spender. Back in the day when he thought his money laid in a bottomless bag, he bought his first wife <a title="Robin Givens Net Worth" href=#>Robin Givens</a> a 24-karat solid gold bathtub for their mansion in Ohio. The price tag? A solid gold $2.3 million. That's a lot of cash for a bathtub to soak away in and it's not like all that gold was able to save their marriage.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-akon---diamond-mine-undisclosed-price><b>2. Akon - Diamond Mine: undisclosed price</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We all know rapping would not be the same if not for the bling, but <a title="Akon Net Worth" href=#>Akon</a> put a whole new meaning to the iced up metaphor when he purchased an entire diamond mine in South Africa in 2007. Now, the famous singer can use the pickaxe to dig for his own diamonds. How many musicians can brag about something like that? Akon prefers to keep the price of his lavish acquisition and exact location a secret.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-kim-basinger---a-town-20-million><b>1. Kim Basinger - A Town: $20 Million</b></h2><p>Can celebrity splurges be any more outrageous? <a title="Kim Basinger Net Worth" href=#>Kim Basinger</a> bought a whole town in Georgia back in 1989 for a whopping $20 million. The Hollywood star became interested in the town of Braselton while stuck in a traffic jam, and purchased it with the intention of turning it into a grand tourist attraction, where people could attend film festivals and visit makeshift movie studios. It soon proved to be a very bad investment, and the whole thing turned out to be a massive failure. Five years later, she sold the town for $1 million and had to declare bankruptcy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e5BsZJ6woJq7tLXVnmSuq5WhsrS%2FjK2foqaXqHqkscuemauhpJ6ytHnBrrBo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f13-expensive-useless-things-celebrities-buy.html&text=13%20Expensive%20Useless%20Things%20Celebrities%20Buy&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f13-expensive-useless-things-celebrities-buy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f13-expensive-useless-things-celebrities-buy.html&title=13%20Expensive%20Useless%20Things%20Celebrities%20Buy" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f13-expensive-useless-things-celebrities-buy.html&title=13%20Expensive%20Useless%20Things%20Celebrities%20Buy" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f13-expensive-useless-things-celebrities-buy.html&title=13%20Expensive%20Useless%20Things%20Celebrities%20Buy" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f13-expensive-useless-things-celebrities-buy.html&description=13%20Expensive%20Useless%20Things%20Celebrities%20Buy" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./13-of-the-most-bizarre-real-life-wwe-friendships.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="13 Of The Most Bizarre Real Life WWE Friendships">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10-different-stages-in-britney-spears-stardom.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Different Stages In Britney Spears' Stardom">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
