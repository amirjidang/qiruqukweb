They aren’t immune to breakup rumors just like the rest of them they have been in the media with divorce rumors. They aren’t getting divorced however and they look happier than ever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They sure surprised everyone when they announced recently that Rachel Weisz was pregnant. Even though the couple has been together for seven years, it’s their first child together. Weisz has a son from a previous relationship and despite the fact that she’s 48 years old she is excited about the pregnancy. She told the New York Times that her glowing skin was the result of her pregnancy. “I’ll be showing soon. Daniel and I are so happy. We’re going to have a little human,” she said. “We can’t wait to meet him or her. It’s all such a mystery!” Daniel Craig also has a 25-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. Weisz and Craig started dating in 2010 when they met on the set of Dream House and the two fell in love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They like&nbsp;to keep their relationship out of the public eye and that’s probably why they have lasted so long. It’s also why they are often amidst divorce rumors. She talked to ES Magazine recently about her relationship. “It’s very personal, it’s very private. I don’t think mine’s particularly exceptional apart from that we’re both in the public eye.”</p><h2 id=he-never-wants-to-let-go-of-her-hand><strong>He Never Wants To Let Go Of Her Hand</strong></h2><p>During the royal world premiere of his latest bond movie Spectre in 2015, Daniel Craig was out supporting his movie. He was holding hands with his favorite lady when Prince Harry approached him. As you can see, Prince Harry is a huge fan of the Bond movies and he was showing off his support. The whole time Craig had not once let go of Weisz’s hand and that’s the cutest thing we have ever seen. Rachel Weisz feels just as strongly of her man.</p><p><strong>“I love being Mrs. Craig. I’m Mrs. Craig on my chequebooks and passports and things. I heard about a movie called ‘Mrs. Craig’ that I want to watch.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This photo is just too cute to handle. Weisz is definitely head over heels with the actor, she has stated that she had a hard time finding love before him. “I was often single and feeling alone in my 20s. I'd eat pizza at home by myself, rent movies, all the clichés&nbsp;— it was hard sometimes, but you hope eventually you'll find the right partner. I worried about so many things and it was hard for me to feel happy or understand what made me happy. Once you reach your forties, you know where to look.”</p><h2 id=she-s-so-proud-of-him><strong>She’s So Proud of Him</strong></h2><p>That’s exactly what this photo shows about the couple. He’s in line waiting to meet guests&nbsp;and she’s taking the opportunity to give him a loving hug. They are so cute together and it’s pretty obvious that Rachel is crazy about him. Weisz is definitely an A-list actress and she has been popping out movies regularly. She has two big releases coming out this year and she has two projects in post-production. She has stated that if she dropped out of Hollywood that she would likely want to be a hippie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“My real fantasy if I was to drop out would be to live in a mobile home and be a hippie and drive around festivals and have millions of children&nbsp;— children with dreadlocks and nose rings&nbsp;— and play the flute.”</strong></p><p>She will have to find the time to have her baby. Being pregnant at 48 is no easy task and it’s going to be something that can be exhausting. More women these days are having babies older, but after the age of 45, you certainly run more risks of complications as well as birth defects. She doesn’t seem to be concerned however and has stated that the two are more than “ready” to welcome the child.</p><h2 id=they-were-friends-first><strong>They Were Friends First</strong></h2><p>Don’t they always say that the best relationships come from two people who were friends first? In the case of these two lovebirds, it seems to be true. Many people were surprised when they married, but it was revealed that they knew each other long before they started dating. During an interview with Marie Claire magazine, Weisz was asked if it was love at first sight with Craig.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I'm going to change the subject. It wasn't really like that. We'd been friends for ages."</strong></p><p>Craig had been previously married before to actress Fiona Loudon. Weisz was also in another relationship at the time with American filmmaker and producer Darren Aronofsky. These two eventually found their way to each other and it wasn’t long before they were married. It’s no wonder that these two prefer to stay at home rather than go to Hollywood parties. “In L.A., unless you've just won an Oscar or you're Mr. Studio Head, no one talks to you. Even at parties.” Hollywood truly is a vapid and sad place to be at times. But like many industries, you have to take the good with the bad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-children-are-happy-they-are-having-a-baby><strong>Their Children Are Happy They Are Having A Baby</strong></h2><p>It’s always great news when your older children support you in the fact that you are starting all over in baby land. As we said before, Craig has a 25-year-old daughter and Weisz has an 11-year-old son. The two kids get along and they couldn’t be happier that their parents are having another child. When she was promoting her film Disobedience, she told E! News that they are all ready to welcome their new child into the world. Preparations are being made and they are stoked. "We are ready. Very excited," gushed the star. Their other children Ella and Henry are also just as excited. Weisz was asked if the children were excited about their new sibling and she said, "Yes,&nbsp;they are. They are really excited." She was in a movie recently with Rachel McAdams who just became a new mom. My Cousin Rachel was all about pushing boundaries for Weisz and McAdams was her love interest in the movie.</p><p><strong>"The story was so powerful — we were in love, there was this mystery, and we've known each other since childhood. It just happened. You can’t force chemistry, it's either there or not."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She gushed about McAdams, "She is very easy to be in love with. She is a beautiful, beautiful person inside and out. And I feel really blessed to have a partner in her. "</p><h2 id=they-knew-they-were-soulmates><strong>They Knew They Were Soulmates</strong></h2><p>When it came to them announcing their relationship, it was just six months before they got married. The two reunited on the set of Dream House, but it was also the same year that Weisz left her relationship for nine years. There were rumors that the two ignited while onset but they denied that they were in a relationship. The two married quickly and they only had four people in attendance including their children. "We did it privately and we've got a lot of people to thank for that," said Craig in an interview with GQ.</p><p><strong>"But that was the point; we did it for private reasons. The whole point is that it was a secret. A secret is a secret."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They are a very private couple, but there are times when they make it pretty obvious that they were meant to be together. During an interview with The Evening Standard Magazine, Weisz said: "I wear my ring with pride." They are beyond cute and a couple that seems like they could stand the test of time, even for a Hollywood relationship. Weisz has stated that throughout her life, she didn’t really get along with people who told her what to do. “I didn't think the teachers had the right to tell me what to do. I would just disobey, talk in the classroom, get very bad grades.”</p><h2 id=they-love-being-married><strong>They Love Being Married</strong></h2><p>For some people, marriage can be difficult at times especially if you are juggling two Hollywood careers but for Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig, it’s a cake walk. It’s so sweet how much Weisz worries about her husband when he’s doing 007 stunts for the Bond movies. She’s been “worried sick” that he could end up permanently injuring himself considering his age. She said that sometimes she couldn’t sleep at night because she worried so much about him. A source told Esquire magazine, "It's a big bone of contention," said the source.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"There's a legacy to all these injuries and she lives with them. They've come to an agreement about how hard he will push himself and he is pulling back from the edge this time. It's a prerequisite."</strong></p><p>He made the decision to play Bond only one more time as he knows his wife does not like it. “Daniel pushes himself very hard and does all his own car chases. But if you do stunts you have to be afraid or you don’t see the danger. He understands that,” said Gary Powell, Craig’s stunt coordinator. Craig admitted though that, “I want to go out with a bang.”</p><h2 id=daniel-refuses-to-wait-to-kiss-her><strong>Daniel Refuses To Wait To Kiss Her</strong></h2><p>That’s Prince Harry still standing in front of the couple and Daniel just doesn’t care. He wants to kiss this girl and he’s not waiting another minute to do so. This is them being married for four years. The honeymoon stage is over and they are still kissing like they are in high school. These two aren’t a fan of red carpet events, they would much rather stay at home and cook.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I love to cook. Daniel is also very good at it. We always enjoy trying out different kinds of cuisine and having fun with that.”</strong></p><p>Weisz wasn’t someone who thought she would ever get married, but there must have been something about Craig that changed her mind. “But I never thought I would get married. It was not an ambition of mine. It was the opposite. I couldn’t relate to romantic comedies — marriage seems to be the whole point of them. Then it just happened, happily, at a more mature moment.” These two seem like an awesome match, they are always so in sync and now they are embarking on a new adventure together with a child. That should prove to be an adventure indeed.</p><h2 id=they-never-talk-about-work-when-they-are-at-home><strong>They Never Talk About Work When They Are At Home</strong></h2><p>It can be easy for two actors to constantly be discussing Hollywood all the time. But they make a conscious effort to leave work at work and to live their lives when they are at home. "I don’t talk about my work, and nor does he. It’s very private," Weisz told The Sun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"There is nothing worse than two actors getting together and talking about acting. It’s like the end — it’s the worst."</strong></p><p>Many have commented on what it must be like to be married to James Bond, but she just thinks that’s silly. In her 2017 interview with Harper's Bazaar, Weisz said: "I did Lorraine [the ITV breakfast show] this morning, and she said, 'So, you're married to Bond!' And I said, 'No, I'm married to someone who pretends to be that character.'" We’re sure the interviewer felt pretty stupid after that. For Weisz, she has built a career out of being flawed characters. “I'm very drawn to characters who are very flawed. I'm less interested in characters who are just good or bad, because to me then they're not real people.” When it comes to acting Weisz has built a career of playing some interesting characters. She has come a long way since The Mummy, but it’s still one of our favorite movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-have-amazing-chemistry><strong>They Have Amazing Chemistry</strong></h2><p>It was all the talk when the two were filming Dream House together. It was rumored that they had some pretty hot chemistry onscreen and apparently offscreen too. They fell in love and it wasn’t long after the movie wrapped that they were married. When asked how she liked being married to Craig, she stated,</p><p><strong>“I’m sorry – I’m a newlywed. I’m still a blushing bride and it’s really private. I can’t tell you anything – come back to me later.”</strong></p><p>The two have worked together on a couple of projects and it always seems to go well. “I really enjoyed working with him,” she says. “We have actually known each other a long time – since our early twenties. He’s a good actor.” The two are often seen on the red carpet, but neither of them enjoys it. Craig has stated that going to promotional events is like “going to the dentist" and Weisz feels the same. “I’m not one for parties and stuff like that,” she adds. “I get a bit nervous around lots of people. I enjoy being invisible.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-are-always-in-sync><strong>They Are Always In Sync</strong></h2><p>Even though we have no problem considering these two relationship goals, Weisz has a problem with it. Maybe it’s because it puts too much pressure on a Hollywood couple to be the example for everyone. There is no relationship out there that is perfect so by claiming that someone is in the perfect relationship may be putting unnecessary pressure to be that way. Weisz in general just doesn’t like branding her personal life for all the world to see. She doesn’t want her relationship portrayed as “goals.” “I really take my hat off to them,” she said.</p><p><strong>“But Daniel and I are really similar. We just literally don’t know how to do that. We’re just really crap at talking about our private lives.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If anything, it’s probably for the best because many couples have crashed and burned because they talked about their relationship too much. She prefers to discuss her career, like the time Keanu Reeves had to dunk her head underwater in Constantine to make it look “real.” “That was me under the bath and the water being held down. The director wanted it to look as real as possible so he told Keanu, in front of me, don't go easy on her. So it was scary.”</p><h2 id=they-are-a-just-a-normal-couple><strong>They Are A Just A Normal Couple</strong></h2><p>They don’t like red carpet events and they would prefer to just stay at home and cook. Yes, these two famous celebrities are just like the rest of us. During an interview with the&nbsp;New York Times, she was asked by Maureen Dowd whether she really did get lasagna and a foot massage every Friday night. Weisz corrected Down proving that we shouldn’t all believe what’s on the Internet when she said, “More like chicken stew with rice,” she said. “And no massage.” It was a funny response and a cute look at the fact that this is just a normal relationship, not something that is more special than anything else. We still think that they are soulmates however because they are just too cute together. Weisz has also stated that she doesn’t believe politics should have anything to do with who you are spending your life with. “I don't believe your soulmate has to share your politics.” As long as you have balance, that’s all that matters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I don't think balance is something you get from someone else; it's something women have to find from within.</strong></p><p>For me, finding balance is still a work in progress.”</p><h2 id=the-most-private-couple-in-hollywood><strong>The Most Private Couple In Hollywood</strong></h2><p>Some of the most talked about couples in Hollywood are the ones that end up failing in the end. That’s not something that these two are interested in. They say they don’t talk about their relationship because they suck at it, but we think it’s more because they want to keep that specialness between them. There is no reason to share something so personal with the world. Somehow Craig managed to change her mind about marriage and get a ring on her finger. Their relationship works because they have similar tastes. We already know that they don’t talk about work when they are alone, instead, they talk about what they love. They enjoy cooking together at home which is super sweet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Maureen Dowd stated that the couple "prefer talking about books and poetry and music to social media."</strong></p><p>It’s these small things that make them very different from the Kardashian and West marriage. “People want to imagine I spend every night going to premieres and putting on frocks and getting into limos, and yet I do that maybe twice a year, if that.” In fact, Weisz thinks it’s fake. “If I went out in killer heels and full makeup, blow dry, the whole thing&nbsp;— anyone dressed up like that could be intimidating to men and women, really. It's so, 'look at me.' Do you know what I mean? But I love women.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-loves-being-taken><strong>She Loves Being "Taken"</strong></h2><p>Despite the fact that she used to believe that she would never get married, Weisz is a happily married woman who has embraced being “taken.” When it comes to her relationship with Craig, she doesn’t mind letting people know that she is proud to be married to him and the fact that he is all hers. She was once asked if she thought that marriage had changed her in any way. At first, she wasn’t sure how to respond to the question. She came back with this. “I mean, I wear a ring all the time,” she said. “I wear my ring with pride. I’m taken.” Many wondered why she was against the institution of marriage during her nine year relationship with her ex whom she has a son with. “You don’t join the institution like it’s the Rotary Club,” she quipped.</p><p><strong>“You make it your own. It’s very personal, it’s very private. I don’t think mine’s particularly exceptional apart from that we’re both in the public eye.”</strong></p><p>There must have been something about Craig that she didn’t find in her previous relationships and that’s likely why he was the man that she chose to marry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-chose-to-honor-their-marriage><strong>They Chose To Honor Their Marriage</strong></h2><p>The reason why the two are so tight-lipped about their relationship is that it’s theirs and they don’t want to share it with anyone. For the seven years that they have spent together, it’s been very important to them to keep their marriage a private matter. She was asked by More during an interview why she was so secretive about her relationship. “He’s just too famous. It would be a betrayal. You have to protect your marriage.” That’s the biggest truth that she could tell in the world of Hollywood and many celebrity couples have had to learn the hard way. “When you’re young, you tell your girlfriends everything,” Weisz added.</p><p><strong>“One of the great pleasures of not being an adolescent is that you don’t have to share everything. When you’re married, that door closes. The audience goes and you’re in your own life.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That’s certainly an interesting take on the whole thing. “I think actors have a choice of drawing attention to themselves or living on the outskirts.” We think she’s pretty smart about the whole thing and if we look at some of the longest-running relationships in Hollywood, they are usually the ones that keep their relationships private.</p><h2 id=his-marriage-is-the-most-important-thing-to-him><strong>His Marriage Is The Most Important Thing To Him&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>It’s not just Weisz that is out there stating that marriages should be kept private, Craig is on board as well. He has stated that his marriage is more much more than money and he wouldn’t risk it for anything.</p><p><strong>“Life is long and I am hopefully in this for the long run. If you sell it off, it’s gone. It’s precious. It’s worth more than money. You can’t buy your privacy back.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even when it comes to their children, they don’t want them out in the limelight either, that’s why we rarely see photographs of them unless they are running through the airport. When she was asked by the Evening Standard if she would mind her son being in the industry, even as a model, she was adamantly against it. “Over my dead body.” He can do a paper round or something, but not photographs. No. He’s a child. I generally don’t talk about him. He didn’t choose to have a mum who’s in the public eye, so I keep him away from my career,” she added. “He’s also not very interested in it.” It’s probably unlikely than that he will be following in his mother’s footsteps. Though both his parents are out there involved in films in one way or another.</p><p>References:&nbsp;<a href=#>people.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>metro.co.uk,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>esquire.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>vanityfair.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>harpersbazaar.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmiqkZi1priMsJyiq6pitrR5z6ucoKaRo8FurdNma3FlYWp6s7HArKanq12stbp50ZqaoZ2cYq6vsIydmKehlaF6pL7Aop5mmaKaerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIygppqko2Q%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frachel-weisz-is-pregnant-at-48-15-reasons-why-rachel-and-daniel-craig-are-relationship-goals.html&text=Rachel%20Weisz%20Is%20Pregnant%20At%2048%3a%2015%20Reasons%20Why%20Rachel%20And%20Daniel%20Craig%20Are%20Relationship%20Goals&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frachel-weisz-is-pregnant-at-48-15-reasons-why-rachel-and-daniel-craig-are-relationship-goals.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frachel-weisz-is-pregnant-at-48-15-reasons-why-rachel-and-daniel-craig-are-relationship-goals.html&title=Rachel%20Weisz%20Is%20Pregnant%20At%2048%3a%2015%20Reasons%20Why%20Rachel%20And%20Daniel%20Craig%20Are%20Relationship%20Goals" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frachel-weisz-is-pregnant-at-48-15-reasons-why-rachel-and-daniel-craig-are-relationship-goals.html&title=Rachel%20Weisz%20Is%20Pregnant%20At%2048%3a%2015%20Reasons%20Why%20Rachel%20And%20Daniel%20Craig%20Are%20Relationship%20Goals" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frachel-weisz-is-pregnant-at-48-15-reasons-why-rachel-and-daniel-craig-are-relationship-goals.html&title=Rachel%20Weisz%20Is%20Pregnant%20At%2048%3a%2015%20Reasons%20Why%20Rachel%20And%20Daniel%20Craig%20Are%20Relationship%20Goals" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frachel-weisz-is-pregnant-at-48-15-reasons-why-rachel-and-daniel-craig-are-relationship-goals.html&description=Rachel%20Weisz%20Is%20Pregnant%20At%2048%3a%2015%20Reasons%20Why%20Rachel%20And%20Daniel%20Craig%20Are%20Relationship%20Goals" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./601991-roddy-piper-tells-hulk-hogan-critics-to-get-a-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Roddy Piper Tells Hulk Hogan Critics to Get a Life Following Racism Scandal">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./why-is-phoebe-dynevor-leaving-bridgerton.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Phoebe Dynevor Hopes She'll Be Invited Back To Bridgerton In The Future Despite No Season 3 Storylin">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
