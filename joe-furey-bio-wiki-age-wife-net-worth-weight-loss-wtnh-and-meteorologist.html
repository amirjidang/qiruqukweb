They came from Newfoundland, Canada, and would sleep with a window open during the winter.</p><p>His grandparents talked about icebergs that went by their house in St John’s, Newfoundland. They even had stories about times in winter when the snow was so deep and drifted, so the only way out of their house was from a second-floor window.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-furey-wife></span><span>Joe Furey Wife</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Furey is married to Tracy Furey who works for WFSB.</strong> The couple is blessed with four amazing daughters and a son named Jake.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-furey-salary></span><span>Joe Furey Salary</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Furey’s annual salary ranges between $60,000 – $79,000.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-furey-net-worth></span><span>Joe Furey Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Furey’s net worth is estimated to be between $1 million and $5 million dollars</strong>.

One of his favorite weather tales is when Dr. Mel put him in charge of setting-up their big-brand new weather data recording station on the roof above the weather office at WCSU. A few weeks later Hurricane Gloria showed up.</p><p>They were all excited when the anemometer registered an 83 mph wind gust and then the weather station flew past the window they were looking out of and smashed on the ground. He had forgotten to secure it to the roof! Ever see Dr. Mel mad?? Another one of Furey’s favorite stories is when he forecasted 1 inch of snow, and we got 1 foot. The next day on-air a bucket of snow landed on his head while he was doing the weather live on TV.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-furey-wtnh></span><span>Joe Furey WTNH</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Furey then moved on to become the Director of The New England Weather Service in Hartford doing daily weather forecasting to such clients as Northeast Utilities.
