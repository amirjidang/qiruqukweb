While each of the Muppet movies has its moments, the 1992 film has a consistent charm about it that audiences and critics alike ate up. No doubt, the Brian Henson-directed film is a far cry from <a href=#>the canceled ABC Muppets </a>show and <a href=#>the Disney show with that very peculiar Kermit the Frog voice</a>. But The Muppet Christmas Carol did signal a notable transition in the series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to the film's release, each and every Muppet movie and show had the magic touch of creator Jim Henson. While <a href=#>Henson originally wanted the Muppets to be rated R</a>, he found a way to create a project that resonated with audience members of all ages. Reaching continuing lofty goal was one of the most daunting tasks in the hands of those left in charge following Henson's tragic passing in 1990. Fortunately, they managed to knock it out of the park with The Muppet Christmas Carol.</p><h2 id=the-sad-origin-of-the-muppet-christmas-carol>The Sad Origin Of The Muppet Christmas Carol</h2><p>Jim Henson's passing changed everything for The Muppet franchise. Following his sudden demise at the hands of severe pneumonia, the franchise he created fell to his son, Brian Henson, who, according to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> a fantastic oral history by The Independent</a>, gathered his father's team together to figure out a plan of action.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was all very risky. Even my dad wasn’t sure what to do next with the Muppets," Brian Henson, who ended up directing The Muppet Christmas Carol, said to The Independent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-muppet-christmas-carol-kermit-piggy-fozzy-gonzo-and-sir-michael-caine.jpg><p>"When he died, he was selling the company to Disney and his big thing was that he was going to do Muppet attractions at Disney World. He was getting very excited about that because I think he was unsure where to go next with the movies. They were tough because you’re trying to tell an original story but with each movie, it was getting a little bit tricky. How do you let these characters be fresh? You fall into ruts," Brian continued.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How The Obscenely Dark Muppets Most Wanted Changed Kermit The Frog Memes Forever</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During his interview with The Independent, Dave Goelz, the man behind the beloved character of Gonzo, revealed that everyone else involved simply couldn't understand how the franchise could move forward.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-muppet-christmas-carol-gonzo-and-ratso.jpg><p>"We were utterly shocked when Jim passed away. He looked frail, he was thin and almost looked gaunt sometimes but he was stronger than any of us," Dave Goelz said to The Independent. "He could outpace anybody and work harder than everybody else, so the idea that he could succumb to something was the furthest thing from our minds. We just couldn’t imagine it. Going forward, we collectively decided that we would try to see if we could keep doing this – and [The Muppet Christmas Carol] was our first major project after that decision."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-the-muppet-christmas-carol-became-a-serious-film>How The Muppet Christmas Carol Became A Serious Film</h2><p>Originally, The Muppet Christmas Carol was actually supposed to be a parody. Everything was supposed to be a joke, not unlike the other Muppets movies. Sure, they all had heart, but there were ultimately comedies.</p><p>However, as director Brian Henson and writer Jerry Juhl were writing, they realized that the material, which was based on the classic by Charles Dickens, was far too good to be parodied. This marked the first time The Muppets delved straight into the drama genre.</p><p>"It was really Jerry [Juhl, writer] saying, 'We can’t parody this. It’s too good. We just have to do it – and I think we can do it better than anyone.'" Brian Henson said to The Independent.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Sesame Street Episode That Got Banned From TV For Being 'Too Frightening'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"[We] really wanted to do this film because of what it said about humanity. Luckily, Brian and his siblings were willing to go ahead and try – and I’m so glad we did," Dave Goelz explained to The Independent.</p><p>"I think his script is around 98 percent Dickens prose. Almost never does he veer from it. 98 percent is probably too high… but it’s mostly Dickens’ prose," Brian Henson added.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Biggest Controversies 'Sesame Street' Has Caused Over The Years</a></span></p><p>Brian Henson went on to say that the idea "liberated" them creatively as they could literally drop their great characters into any story and make it fresh.</p><p>"It allowed what had been baggage, making it hard for my dad to keep making Muppet movies, to become a plus too. It also made it an exciting way to go," Henson said to The Independent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-muppet-christmas-carol-kermit-and-tiny-tim.jpg><p>The Muppet Christmas Carol went on the be received positively despite some criticism about it not having enough of the typical Muppet's shtick.
