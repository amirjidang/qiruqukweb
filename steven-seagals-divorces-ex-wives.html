His first marriage was with Miyako Fujitani, who is Japanese. They got married in December 1974. Seagal left Miyako back in Japan and headed to the US, where he met actress and model, Kelly Lebrock and had an affair with her almost immediately. When information about Seagal's affair with Kelly Lebrock got to Miyako, she filed for divorce in 1984.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the ongoing divorce proceedings with Miyako and amidst his affair with Kelly Lebrock, <strong>Steven Seagal unexpectedly tied the knot with Adrienne La Russa in 1984.</strong> However, the marriage was brief as it was annulled within the same year due to Seagal's unresolved divorce from Miyako.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/steven-seagal-during-a-2018-comic-con-signing-event.jpg><p>Reports suggest that Adrienne may not have been aware of Seagal's ongoing marriage to Miyako when she agreed to marry him. However, since their divorce, there hasn't been much news about Adrienne, except that she went on to marry Robert French in 1987. <strong>She prefers to live a relatively private life</strong>, away from the public eye. This choice is likely influenced by the fact that the couple did not have any children together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/steven-seagal-broke-sean-connery-s-bone-and-did-long-term-damage-to-the-hollywood-legend-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Steven Seagal Broke Sean Connery's Bone And Did Long Term Damage To The Hollywood Legend</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Sean Connery's interaction with Steven Seagal resulted in the James Bond actor suffering a lasting injury.</span><p>After finalizing their divorce, <strong>Miyako remained committed to living a simple and private life in Osaka</strong>, her place of birth. She remained unmarried, channeling her energy into training her children and running her Aikido school.</p><p>In 1987, according to US Magazine, following the conclusion of his divorce with Miyako Fujitani, <strong>Seagal married Hollywood sensation Kelly Lebrock.</strong> Their marriage flourished for seven years until it ended in 1994. Rumors circulated that Seagal had an affair with their babysitter, Arissa Wolf, which allegedly led to their divorce. However, Kelly Lebrock stated that she filed for divorce citing "irreconcilable differences" with Seagal.</p><p>Another controversy that has shadowed Seagal's career and contributed to his divorce from Kelly Lebrock was the repeated accusations of sexual assault made against him by numerous women over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bd9d3752-0156-4276-9c4c-0ca874a1585d.jpeg><p>In May 1991, while still married to Kelly Lebrock, <strong><a href=#>Seagal faced allegations of sexual harassment</a></strong> from Raenne Malone, Nicole Selinger, and Christine Keeve, who were employees of Warner Bros.

I decided to swap my old life in Beverly Hills for a new one in the country, in Santa Barbara.</p><p>As a mother hen would always protect her chicks, Kelly Lebrock was forced to retreat from the public eye for the sake of her children. She went on to say:</p><p>When I split with Steven [Seagal], the divorce was very ugly, and details of the case were on the evening news, I didn’t want my kids seeing it, so I simply got rid of the TV.
