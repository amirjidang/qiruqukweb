Other members of the cast include Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, Levi Miller, Deric McCabe, Chris Pine, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw.

In the first, the screenlife thriller “Missing,” she played a teenager trying to find her missing mother through the Internet. A sequel to the 2018 film “Searching,” the film was a solid critical and commercial hit. Reid’s second film of 2023 was another sequel, the gothic supernatural horror film “The Nun II.” She starred alongside Taissa Farmiga, Jonas Bloquet, and Anna Popplewell in the commercially successful film.</p><h2 id=television-career><span class=ez-toc-section id=television-career></span><strong>Television Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Reid first appeared on television in 2012, playing the young version of Danielle Deadwyler’s protagonist Erica in the made-for-TV movie “A Cross to Bear.” She next appeared in episodes of the series “The Thundermans” and “Adam DeVine’s House Party” in 2013.
