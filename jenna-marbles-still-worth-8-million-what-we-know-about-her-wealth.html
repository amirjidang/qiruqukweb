Although her real name is in fact Jenna Nicole Mourey, this 33-year-old YouTuber has an emblematic persona on the video platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jenna entered the world of YouTube videos in 2010, back when there wasn't such a thing as being an '<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram influencer</a>'&nbsp;or even a 'Vlogger'. As she uploaded her first video, under a pseudonym she made up based on the name of her famous Chihuahua, "Mr. Marbles", Jenna went viral. This was thanks to her video, "How To Trick People Into Thinking You're Good Looking".</p><p>The video made YouTube history&nbsp;after it was viewed over 5.3 million times in its first week. What happened next is history.</p><p>As one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most established YouTubers in the world</a>, Jenna's net worth is estimated to be $8 million. In this article, we take a look at everything we know about her wealth.</p><h2 id=jenna-makes-at-least-6000-per-video><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Jenna Makes At Least $6000 Per Video</span></h2><p>As some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">articles by industry insiders</a>&nbsp;reveal that advertised videos usually make between $0.10 to $0.30 per view, this would mean that a YouTube channel would typically receive $18 per 1,000 ad views. Although the math may seem a little confusing, we can estimate Jenna Marbles' videos to earn her approximately $6000, as she always has between 2 to 4 million views per uploaded video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber Breaks Record With More Than 54 Million Subscribers On YouTube</a></span></p><h2 id=she-receives-money-for-attending-events><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>She Receives Money For Attending Events</span></h2><p>Once a person has officially reached celebrity status, they can earn money from basically anything. This includes attending events. Public events are great ways to promote brands and having a popular YouTuber, such as Jenna Marbles, representing a brand can be an ideal marketing initiative. It is very likely that the YouTuber gets paid when asked to attend certain events.</p><h2 id=her-yearly-income-was-over-300-000-in-2013><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Her Yearly Income Was Over $300,000 in 2013</span></h2><p>Back in 2013, an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">article published in Business Insider</a>&nbsp;stated&nbsp;that the YouTuber's yearly income was $346,000. During that year, Jenna had less than 15 million subscribers, and a little less than 1 billion views in total. Now, the 33-year-old YouTube star has over 19 million subscribers and nearly 3 billion views. Therefore, we can only guess that Jenna's yearly income has doubled, if not tripled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-also-makes-money-from-her-twitch-channel><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>She Also Makes Money From Her Twitch Channel</span></h2><p>In addition to her very popular YouTube channel, which has been running for a decade now, Jenna shares a Twitch channel with her partner, Julien. Their video gaming platform has over 230,00 followers and helps the couple to add additional income. Ads are playing simultaneously videos while viewers are watching.</p><h2 id=jenna-gets-money-from-her-sponsored-podcast><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Jenna Gets Money From Her Sponsored Podcast</span></h2><p>The 33-year-old YouTube star works on many projects. Indeed, Jenna also makes an income from a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast</a> she runs with her boyfriend. Jenna and Julien discuss fan fiction, conspiracy theories, personal stories, and more. Jenna and Julien's podcast is also sponsored, which allows the couple to receive a steady stream of money.</p><h2 id=she-earned-money-from-acting><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>She Earned Money From Acting</span></h2><p>The YouTube star hasn't limited herself to her channel. As a matter of fact, Jenna has acted on other platforms. For instance, in 2014, Jenna played the role of Miley Cyrus in a YouTube segment of YouTube Rewind 2013. She also appeared as herself in Smosh: The Movie. Who knows? Maybe she'll end up doing more acting gigs in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-has-her-own-dog-toys-brand><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>She Has Her Own Dog Toys Brand</span></h2><p>People love their pets and Jenna has gotten in on the dog toys trend by offering her very own brand of dog toys. As you can see from the photo, her dog toys are really cute. This is one more way that the YouTuber makes bank. She's certainly taking advantage of every opportunity to build wealth.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Food Puzzle Toys Every Dog Needs In Their Life</a></span></p><h2 id=jenna-still-sells-merch><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jenna Still Sells Merch</span></h2><p>Just like most popular YouTubers, Jenna sells merchandise, which naturally makes for a great income. This merchandise is expected to be sold soon at Jenna and Julien's official website. Hopefully, merch options will include cool new masks to wear during the COVID-19 pandemic!</p><h2 id=she-earns-money-from-her-radio-host-gig><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She Earns Money From Her Radio Host Gig</span></h2><p>It is unclear whether "Miss Marbles" will continue her radio work; however, she did host a weekly radio segment for many years. That's right - since 2014, Jenna hosted a weekly pop countdown on SiriusXM Hits. This type of regular work is always an amazing opportunity for a YouTuber. It's allowed Jenna to expand her talents, gain recognition and, naturally, increase her net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-worked-as-an-executive-producer><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Worked As An Executive Producer</span></h2><p>Jenna Mourey, A.K.A Jenna Marbles, has also stepped into behind-the-camera work for a film. That's right - in 2016, Jenna worked as an executive producer for a movie called&nbsp;Maximum Ride. The movie features the actress, Allie Marie Evans, the actor Gavin Lewis, and other talented cast members.</p><h2 id=jenna-has-received-multiple-awards><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jenna Has Received Multiple Awards</span></h2><p>Subscribers and views aren't the only things that matter to a YouTuber. Jenna's longtime dedication and passion, which lead her to create memorable video content, have also led her to be awarded multiple times.</p><p>Naturally, this public recognition makes Jenna's name more valuable. She has been nominated multiple times at the Streamy Awards and has even won Creator Of The Decade at the 2018 Streamy Awards.</p><h2 id=she-has-nearly-20-million-subscribers><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She Has Nearly 20 Million Subscribers</span></h2><p>Like we have mentioned before, Jenna has nearly 20 million subscribers. Having subscribers is an essential part of getting regular views. In Jenna's case, this amount of subscribers basically guarantees that her videos always have at least 2 million views each. This ultimately earns her a significant income, just from her YouTube videos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-even-has-her-own-statue><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She Even Has Her Own Statue</span></h2><p>A major stepping stone to success is having your very own wax figure, as recognition for years of hard work and fame. In 2015, Jenna received her wax statue at the New York Madame Tussauds museum. This was a milestone moment, which secured Jenna's important position within the entertainment industry!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Terrifying Wax Figures That Look Nothing Like People</a></span></p><h2 id=jenna-has-reached-almost-3-billion-views-on-youtube><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jenna Has Reached Almost 3 Billion Views On YouTube</span></h2><p>As we have mentioned above, advertising videos often result in good money per 1000 views. Jenna has now officially reached over 2 billion views, and the number is rapidly increasing every week, so we can only imagine the value of her YouTube channel. Jenna Marbles'&nbsp;views are significantly high, and therefore, contribute greatly to her&nbsp;wealth.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How YouTuber Jeffree Star Got So Wealthy</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaelnqurdGbo56rXajBqrjLZq6oqqSdenl5zKKjpaGfo3q4tMCtZLCdXaC7sMOMmpmoraRitaa%2BjLCcmqSknXw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjenna-marbles-still-worth-8-million-what-we-know-about-her-wealth.html&text=Is%20Jenna%20Marbles%20Still%20Worth%20%248%20Million%3f%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20Her%20Wealth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjenna-marbles-still-worth-8-million-what-we-know-about-her-wealth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjenna-marbles-still-worth-8-million-what-we-know-about-her-wealth.html&title=Is%20Jenna%20Marbles%20Still%20Worth%20%248%20Million%3f%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20Her%20Wealth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjenna-marbles-still-worth-8-million-what-we-know-about-her-wealth.html&title=Is%20Jenna%20Marbles%20Still%20Worth%20%248%20Million%3f%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20Her%20Wealth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjenna-marbles-still-worth-8-million-what-we-know-about-her-wealth.html&title=Is%20Jenna%20Marbles%20Still%20Worth%20%248%20Million%3f%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20Her%20Wealth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjenna-marbles-still-worth-8-million-what-we-know-about-her-wealth.html&description=Is%20Jenna%20Marbles%20Still%20Worth%20%248%20Million%3f%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20Her%20Wealth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-venus-williams-gay.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Venus Williams Gay?
