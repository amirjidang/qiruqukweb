Spade spoke about his assistant "Skippy" attacking him in his home. It was an incident that almost took Spade's life, and he wondered if he'd make it out of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, Spade had finished shooting the cult-classic, Joe Dirt, and was spending several hours a day in the editing room. After a long day, Spade told Stern that things took a turn he could never have predicted.</p><p>Spade revealed, "The movie Joe Dirt, we were editing that day. Skippy and we edited the movie. Perfectly normal. I go to bed, 6 AM he's in my room. I got scared. He said the alarm company called. Then he punched me in the face and hit me with stun gun."</p><p>From that point on, it was all about escaping for Spade, who took several shots to the face from his assistant. Once he finally started to fight back, Warren's attack slowed down. Spade escaped a scary situation.</p><p>He revealed the details with Howard Stern, but the sound effects definitely hurt Spade's story...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/david-spade-told-jimmy-kimmel-that-his-conversation-with-sydney-sweeney-took-an-awkward-turn-after-he-mentioned-her-brother-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="David Spade Told Jimmy Kimmel That His Conversation With Sydney Sweeney Took An Awkward Turn After He Mentioned Her Brother ">David Spade Told Jimmy Kimmel That His Conversation With Sydney Sweeney Took An Awkward Turn After He Mentioned Her Brother</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>David Spade met Sydney Sweeney on a plane, and things took a turn after Spade brought up his encounter with her brother.</p><p>Spade was a class act following the situation, as still, he refused to bash his assistant.</p><h2 id=david-spade-took-the-classy-way-out-when-speaking-about-his-personal-assistant>David Spade Took The Classy Way Out When Speaking About His Personal Assistant</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spade sent his regards to the attacker</a>. According to Spade, Warren is a "good person." The actor said in his statement, "David Malloy was a good friend of mine for five years," Spade said in a statement.

The attack all stemmed from Spade going out with Lowe the night prior, and not extending Farley an invite.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/chris-farley-looking-upset-from-beverly-hills-ninja.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spade recalled the details of their fight. “How’s Rob Lowe?” Farley asked again. “How’s your precious Rob Lowe? How was drinks last night,” Farley asks. “Oh, is that what we’re getting at?” Spade asked. “It was fine. It was all right.” “So, you call f****** Rob Lowe, so you can have a little date with him, but you don’t call me?”</p><p>“I stand up and say, ‘Are we in a fight?’ And the [director says on the walkie-talkie], ‘Action!’ and [Farley and I] just stare at each other, and we turn and we walk in.”</p><p>Things only got worse from then on, as Farley attacked another crew member, looking to fight someone his size.</p><p>Once again, Spade took the humble approach, choosing to look back at the positives of his relationship with Chris Farley.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Look, we had a blast,” Spade said. “All my memories of Tommy Boy were fun. It was stressful. It was hard. You wish you could enjoy how much the movie will be remembered at the time. But Tommy Boy, I hear about more than any other movie … We had great seats for Farley, so I love it. I’m just glad to be a part of something.”</p><p>Credit to Spade for constantly keeping a cool head despite such situations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6ZmXq0vMCdnGamlZa%2FbrDEmquhZZWtvaa%2ByJ6lnJ1dn7ymecOiqa1n</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdavid-spade-near-death-experience-joe-dirt.html&text=David%20Spade%20Revealed%20The%20Chilling%20Details%20Of%20How%20His%20Life%20Almost%20Came%20To%20An%20End%20While%20Filming%20Joe%20Di&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-spade-near-death-experience-joe-dirt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-spade-near-death-experience-joe-dirt.html&title=David%20Spade%20Revealed%20The%20Chilling%20Details%20Of%20How%20His%20Life%20Almost%20Came%20To%20An%20End%20While%20Filming%20Joe%20Di" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdavid-spade-near-death-experience-joe-dirt.html&title=David%20Spade%20Revealed%20The%20Chilling%20Details%20Of%20How%20His%20Life%20Almost%20Came%20To%20An%20End%20While%20Filming%20Joe%20Di" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-spade-near-death-experience-joe-dirt.html&title=David%20Spade%20Revealed%20The%20Chilling%20Details%20Of%20How%20His%20Life%20Almost%20Came%20To%20An%20End%20While%20Filming%20Joe%20Di" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-spade-near-death-experience-joe-dirt.html&description=David%20Spade%20Revealed%20The%20Chilling%20Details%20Of%20How%20His%20Life%20Almost%20Came%20To%20An%20End%20While%20Filming%20Joe%20Di" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./duggar-family-has-first-ugly-christmas-sweater-party-pics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Duggar Family Has First Ugly Christmas Sweater Party: Pics">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./david-frost-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David Frost Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
