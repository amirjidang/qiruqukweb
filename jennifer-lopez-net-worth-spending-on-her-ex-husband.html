She hasn't entirely done this through acting or music. There's one thing that Jennifer excels at that has kept her as a superstar, and it's her public image. No one can deny that what really keeps Jennifer a household name are her star-studded, tabloid-covering relationships.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What gets lost in all of that is real relationships are occurring. There's more to it than where these couples are vacationing at, or what their exact status is at any given moment. Real chemistry happens between these people. One way people show their affection and love is through gift-giving, and Jennifer, as rich as she is, has certainly spent a fortune on her famous exes. Forbes has reported Jennifer's net worth to be $400 million, so she has no reason to keep it frugal. Other than to protect her own heart, maybe.</p><p>Here are some things she's purchased for her famous exes, and what things some of her exes have gifted to her in return.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez-39-s-first-marriage-with-ojani-noa-ended-with-the-oddest-gift-of-all><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jennifer Lopez's First Marriage With Ojani Noa Ended With The Oddest Gift Of All</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jennifer-Lopez-and-Ojani-Noa.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer's first big relationship was her marriage with Ojani Noa. For the majority of the 90s, J-Lo was relatively unknown. She danced for In Living Color, and had many small roles in feature films. However, Jennifer broke out in 1997 due to her starring role as the singer Selena in the classic self-titled biopic. That same year, she got married to Ojani, and the two events cemented Jennifer as a rising star. This couple just couldn't stay out of the limelight.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Rosie Perez Revealed Jennifer Lopez Manipulated The Wardrobe And Makeup To Her Advantage During In Living Color</a></span></p><p>That was until they parted ways. In 1998, the two got divorced from each other. According to Express, there were rumors that Ojani cheated on Jennifer, which was the cause of their relationship's demise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's unknown what Jennifer ever gifted Ojani, but Jennifer's biggest gift received from the relationship would be a court settlement of over $500 thousand. According to Reuters, this was after Jennifer sued Ojani over a book that was supposed to expose Jennifer. Some of the information was deemed as "intimate", and not only did Ojani have to cough up the money, he wasn't allowed to release any personal information about Jennifer.</p><p>Since his marriage to Jennifer, <a href=#>Ojani's life has changed</a> in a lot of ways.</p><h2 id=ben-affleck-still-has-the-watch-jennifer-lopez-gave-him-20-years-ago><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ben Affleck Still Has The Watch Jennifer Lopez Gave Him 20 Years Ago</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopez.jpg><p>Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck may no longer be exes, but there was a 20-year gap between their first relationship and their current one. Both of them have changed a lot, and seem to be a lot more mature in their dating ways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, while their new relationship is a lot more safe and secure than it was all those years ago, they haven't lost sight of their passion. This is evident in the fact that Ben was caught recently out in public wearing a gift watch that Jennifer gave him years ago. The same watch appeared in Jennifer's "Jenny From The Block" music video, in which Ben had a cameo. It's not just some boring watch either - it was a Franck Muller with an embedded Chrome Hearts bracelet.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez-still-has-her-first-engagement-ring-from-ben-affleck><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jennifer Lopez Still Has Her First Engagement Ring From Ben Affleck</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ben-Affleck-and-Jennifer-Lopez.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After their romance heated up in 2002, it dominated the media in 2003. Ben and Jennifer first got engaged in 2003, and their notorious Gigli movie was released in theaters that year as well. Gigli completely tanked at the box office and was another wasted role from Jennifer's prime. It even resulted in <a href=#>the firing</a> of Jennifer's business team. It may have even resulted in the cancelation of their wedding, which was followed up by their official breakup in 2004.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez Went 'Steven Seagal' On SNL, Turning Down A Skit That She Didn't Deem Believable</a></span></p><p>Despite the disastrous end to a passionate relationship, the two didn't entirely throw everything away.

Diddy actually planned on gifting Jennifer and Ben a "pair of Rolls-Royces".
