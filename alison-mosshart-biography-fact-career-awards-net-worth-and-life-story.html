She started her musical career in 1995 with the Florida punk rock band Discount which disbanded in 2000. She then co-founded The Kills with British guitarist Jamie Hince (formerly of Scarfo and Blyth Power) in 2000 in London.<br>In The Kills’ first album, Mosshart was known by her stage name “VV” and Hince was known as “Hotel”.<br>In early 2009, she joined the supergroup The Dead Weather, formed by Jack White, along with Jack Lawrence and Dean Fertita. In that band, her stage name is “Baby Ruthless.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span><span id=Career>Career</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mosshart features on the 2006 Primal Scream song “Dolls (Sweet Rock and Roll)”, from the album <i>Riot City Blues</i>, as well as on the Placebo song “Meds”, the title track of their 2006 album.

They performed the song “Paris Summer”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-kills></span><span id=The_Kills>The Kills</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before the two even met, Mosshart and Hince overheard each other playing music while sharing the same hotel during Mosshart’s European tour with Discount. They finally met up, and started playing around with some music ideas. After she went back to Florida, she continued writing songs with Jamie, by sending her ideas overseas to London, where he lived. She became very exhausted and ill, so after saving money, Mosshart moved to London and the duo officially started. She has tattooed the date of their first concert on her left hand: 14 February 2002.</p><p>In 2003, The Kills released their first album <i>Keep on Your Mean Side</i>.

It was released April 5 in the U.S. and April 4 elsewhere. The album is their most commercially successful to date. During the ‘Blood Pressures’ tour they celebrated their 10-year anniversary on February 11, 2012. They have released a photography book called Dream & Drive of their past 9 years with the photographer Kenneth Capello.</p><p>On June 26, 2014, The Kills opened for Jack White in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, Dublin, for White’s Lazaretto tour. Mosshart joined White to perform White’s song “Love Interruption”, and both Mosshart and Hince joined White to perform Leadbelly’s “Goodnight Irene”.</p><p>On June 3, 2016, The Kills released their new album <i>Ash and Ice</i>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-dead-weather></span><span id=The_Dead_Weather>The Dead Weather</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mosshart is one of the original members of the blues rock band The Dead Weather, formed in late 2008.
