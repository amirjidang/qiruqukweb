During a taping of The Morning Show, which Jennifer Aniston co-stars in with <a href=#>Reese Witherspoon</a>, the lead singer and guitarist of the Foo Fighters made an appearance along with the rest of his band. Aniston was clearly ecstatic and her social media post bragging about the meeting is now all over Google. Type the words “Dave Grohl Jennifer Aniston” into the search engine and you will see nothing but pages upon pages about the band’s cameo and Aniston’s self-proclaimations of super fandom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Jennifer Aniston Make More On The Morning Show Than On Friends?</a></span></p><p>Some people might not know this, but the band’s appearance on Aniston’s new show is not the first time she and the former Nirvana drummer have crossed paths with one another. Although the two of them have never been romantically involved with each other (as far as we know), they have definitely been more than cordial with each other since their first meeting in 2003. Whenever the two are spotted together, they seem to put out the vibe of two friends having a good time together.</p><p>Here is what we know about the Foo Fighters frontman's relationship with A-list film and television star Jennifer Aniston.</p><h2 id=aniston-is-a-self-proclaimed-foo-fighters-superfan><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Aniston is A Self Proclaimed Foo Fighters Superfan</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When news of Grohl and his band’s set visit hit the internet, pictures of Dave Grohl and Jennifer Aniston running lines together went viral along with a series of other behind-the-scenes photos shared by Aniston, including a video where we can see the entire band recording a performance of their song "Making a Fire," which is from their album Medicine At Midnight. In the pictures shared by Aniston, she describes herself as a “Foo Fighters Superfan,” and says that their day on the set was one that she "will never forget.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dave Grohl Brings Child Drummer On Stage During Foo Fighters Concert</a></span></p><h2 id=aniston-and-grohl-first-met-for-an-interview-in-2003><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Aniston and Grohl First Met For An Interview In 2003</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Grohl and the band’s set visit was not the first time that Aniston and he ran into each other. In 2003, while promoting her movie Bruce Almighty, which she starred in with comedian <a href=#>Jim Carey</a>, the two met for an interview. Grohl claims in the video that his friends were jealous that he got to interview Aniston because she is “a total babe.” Grohl also admitted at the time that he was nervous because he is not a trained interviewer. Footage of the interview is still available on the Foo Fighters Live Youtube channel.</p><h2 id=in-the-2003-interview-aniston-helped-grohl-figure-out-what-he-was-doing><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>In the 2003 Interview, Aniston Helped Grohl Figure Out What He Was Doing</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Grohl proved that he was not a trained interviewer in the clip because he approached their meeting more as a conversation, at least at first. Instead of asking questions at the top of the interview, he seems to be “shooting the breeze” more with Aniston, as the old turn of phrase goes. But Aniston, ever the patient one, gave him some polite guidance to help him along, “Do you maybe want to ask me about my character?” She says with a smile at the beginning of their talk. He eventually found a rhythm and asked questions typical of celebrity interviews, like questions about her personal life, whether she prefers working in television or movies, etc. All in all, it appeared that Aniston enjoyed the time with Grohl.</p><h2 id=the-two-hang-out-together-at-major-hollywood-parties><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Two Hang Out Together At Major Hollywood Parties</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Along with his TheMorning Show cameo and their 2003 interview, Aniston and Grohl have been spotted together along with other mutual celebrity friends at a few parties. In photos from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair Oscar Party in 2012</a>, nine years after their Bruce Almighty promo interview, the two can be seen together goofing around and making funny faces to the camera.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Dave Grohl Created His Hit Song 'Everlong'</a></span></p><h2 id=they-were-spotted-together-before-the-pandemic><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Were Spotted Together Before The Pandemic</span></h2><p>Although the actual <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photos</a> seem to have been wiped from the internet for whatever reason, prior to the pandemic the two were spotted together in public hanging out, perhaps discussing the possibility of giving Grohl and the Foo Fighters a cameo on Aniston's next show. Either that, or perhaps they were just friends out and about, enjoying each other’s company and catching up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=people-are-wondering-what-the-band-rsquo-s-lsquo-morning-show-rsquo-cameo-means><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>People Are Wondering What The Band’s ‘Morning Show’ Cameo Means</span></h2><p>While there is no need to conjecture about whether or not Grohl and Aniston are friends, or whether or not Aniston is a Foo Fighters fan, what remains unknown is what Grohl and the band's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cameo</a> will entail for the show's plot. What we do know is that Grohl and his band will be playing themselves as not only do they make an appearance, they perform one of their songs with the band's name displayed behind them, which prompted Aniston to tweet her fangirl posts, saying her “mind was blown.” Fans of both The Morning Show and The Foo Fighters would be wise to pay very close attention to the upcoming episodes so that they can spot their favorite rockers, and they might also see how hard it was for Aniston to contain her excitement and stay in character. Anyone excited to meet their favorite band would have trouble working the rest of the day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Dave Grohl Once Appeared In This Hit TV Show</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52irsGptc2gZLCdXaC7sMOMmpmoraRit6a6zaKdnqpdlruqv9OopWackauybrPRqJ%2BlZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2feverything-we-know-about-jennifer-aniston-dave-grohl-relationship.html&text=Everything%20We%20Know%20About%20Dave%20Grohl%20and%20Jennifer%20Aniston%27s%20Relationship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feverything-we-know-about-jennifer-aniston-dave-grohl-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2feverything-we-know-about-jennifer-aniston-dave-grohl-relationship.html&title=Everything%20We%20Know%20About%20Dave%20Grohl%20and%20Jennifer%20Aniston%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2feverything-we-know-about-jennifer-aniston-dave-grohl-relationship.html&title=Everything%20We%20Know%20About%20Dave%20Grohl%20and%20Jennifer%20Aniston%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2feverything-we-know-about-jennifer-aniston-dave-grohl-relationship.html&title=Everything%20We%20Know%20About%20Dave%20Grohl%20and%20Jennifer%20Aniston%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feverything-we-know-about-jennifer-aniston-dave-grohl-relationship.html&description=Everything%20We%20Know%20About%20Dave%20Grohl%20and%20Jennifer%20Aniston%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./giacomo-gianniotti-on-meredith-and-delucas-demise-greys-endgame.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Giacomo Gianniotti on Meredith and DeLucas 'Demise,' 'Grey's' Endgame">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./elon-musk-sells-old-twitter-memorabilia-as-company-hemorrhages-millions.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elon Musk Sells Old Twitter Memorabilia As Company Hemorrhages Millions">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
