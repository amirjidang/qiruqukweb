The premise was brilliant, and the show became a success on the small screen.</p><p>During the first season, relationship coach Jodi Rogers helped a number of the show's cast members, which included people like Michael, Kelvin, Chloe, Maddi, Olivia, Mark, Andrew and more, to learn dating norms assist them in finding love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After a successful debut season, a second one was right around the corner.

Instead of being Down Under, the show headed stateside and focused on single adults finding love in a brand new setting.</p><p>This version of the show was very similar to its predecessor, which is a great thing. The original version struck a golden balance of social life, interviews, and dating life, and the showrunners were wise to keep things as uniform as possible.</p><p>The show's cast featured Dani, Abbey, Steve, Kaelynn, and James. Each cast member tried their hand at finding love, though all of them weren't successful.

Australians were a lot more fluid in their search for a partner compared to the Americans who are all speaking from an heteronormative perspective. (I feel you can see being different or natural - at least on television - is less encouraged, as you said, in a lot of tv shows that have international versions.)," they wrote.</p><p>Another focused their comment on one of the show's most popular figures.</p><p>"James is an absolute gem. I was crying tears of laughter watching him and his parents banter. The whole bit where he thought he lost his checkbook, his mom offers to drive to two different banks only for him to discover it was in his desk all along. Lol.
