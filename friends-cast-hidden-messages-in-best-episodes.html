Almost two decades later, the obsession with Friends is unstoppable. This is something the creators and cast were unlikely to have foreseen when making the show. Nevertheless, their decision to thread hidden messages, meanings, and easter eggs into the best episodes of the show seems an inspired and forward-thinking choice.</p><p>Not unlike <a href=#>what Chuck Lorre did with The Big Bang Theory finale</a>, co-creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman, as well as the cast, such as <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> and <a href=#>David Schwimmer</a>, found ways of delighting fans with elusive nudges and winks that have only been uncovered in recent years...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-hidden-messages-in-friends>The Hidden Messages In Friends</h2><p>Rewatching the 236 episodes of Friends can reveal a lot to diehard fans. The wardrobe and backgrounds featured in many of the episodes actually feature a number of hidden meanings, messages, and tidbits. One such example occurs in Season 4, Episode 22, "The Worst Best Man Ever" when Joey and Chandler through Ross a bachelor's party.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ross-and-emily-friends.png><p>In the episode, Joey and Chandler's apartment is sloppily decorated for the evening. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Republic World</a>, if you look closely at the banners, one would see that they are adorned with condoms. Given the censors, it's likely that the cast and crew did this in secret hoping the suits at NBC wouldn't notice.

In the Season 8 episode "The One With The Tea Leaves" David Schwimmer is wearing a shirt with two hands with their index fingers locked. According to Mirror.UK, this means "friends" in sign language.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/david-schwimmer-as-ross-gellar-in-friends.jpg><p>Perhaps one of the most famous hidden gems in Friends is the "reserved" sign on the table at Central Perk. While this sign is present throughout most episodes, it appears to be a hidden gag by the production team poking fun at the fact that no one but the main cast ever sat in that specific spot in the cafe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another hidden message in Friends comes in Season 5's "The One In Vegas - Part 1". When Joey is on the phone with Phoebe, he asks her to retrieve his PIN number which he scratched into an ATM machine near his apartment. The number ends up being "5639". This is particularly funny as those numbers correlate with the letters "J.O.E.Y". That's right, Joey's PIN number is his name.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston Never Liked The "Rachel" Haircut, Even Though Fans Imitated It</a></span></p><p>Following the 9/11 attack, Friends, which was set in New York City, paid tribute to the New York City Fire Department.

According to Mirror.UK, diehard fans uncovered a strange shadow lurking in the oven in Joey's apartment. The moment occurs when Joey is breaking apart the foosball table in search of the baby chick and duck.</p><p>If you recall, the original chick and duck were "sent off to a farm".
