Thus, the identity of&nbsp;<strong>Carolyn’s parents</strong>&nbsp;is still unclear. It is also not known if she has any siblings. Nevertheless, this section will be updated as soon as it is available.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=carolyn-cohen-and-alan-dershowitz></span>Carolyn Cohen and Alan Dershowitz<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Carolyn is the second wife to Alan Dershowitz.

Elon is a film producer while Jamin is an attorney. Sue and Alan separated in 1973 and divorced in 1976. Sue was initially given custody of the kids.

She also joined her husband as a staffer at Harvard. Cohen was a supervisor and clinician at Harvard Medical School. She is listed as one of the co-authors of a study published by the Harvard Department of Psychiatry. The research team spent 12 years following 120 children and adolescents they defined as “high-risk.”</p><p>The goal was to study how a person’s cognitive skills and deficits impacted their “psychopathology and recovery.” They also analyzed the young people’s mental health and risk for suicide as they transitioned into adulthood. She has as well been listed as the co-author of multiple studies published by prominent medical journals.</p><p>One of those, published in 1992 in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, worked to develop a system for testing cognitive function in elderly patients. Cohen is also named in a 1991 study published in JAMA Neurology, about Alzheimer’s and dementia.</p><p>It appears that Carolyn did not limit her work to just the northeast, or to just research. Cohen and her husband Alan also own a home in Miami Beach, and Cohen appears to have had a psychology practice there. An inactive LinkedIn page names Cohen as retired psychology in Miami Beach.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=carolyn-cohen-philanthropist></span>Carolyn Cohen Philanthropist<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cohen is a person who seeks to promote the welfare of others, especially by the generous donation of money to good causes. She was a clinical psychologist. As referenced above, she worked on a research team that followed at-risk children and analyzed their development and mental health. But Cohen didn’t limit her interaction with children to just her research. She also volunteered in at least two of her communities.</p><p>According to the website Little Sis, which is maintained by a non-profit research group called the Public Accountability Initiative, Cohen worked as a volunteer for several years. She helped serve children in impoverished neighborhoods in Boston and Miami. She also reportedly served on boards that worked to provide opportunities and assistance to children and their families in underprivileged areas.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=carolyn-cohen-house></span>Carolyn Cohen House<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Carolyn and her husband Alan Dershowitz have plenty of places to go and unwind. They own homes in Martha’s Vineyard, Miami Beach, and Manhattan. Alan is originally from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, but he and Cohen chose the upscale neighborhood Sutton Place on the east side of Manhattan to call home. The duo paid $1.68 million in 2012 for a three-bedroom apartment on the 16th floor, at 45 Sutton Place.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-carolyn-cohen></span>Frequently Asked Questions About Carolyn Cohen<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-carolyn-cohen></span>Who is Carolyn Cohen?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Carolyn Cohen is an American neuropsychologist well-known as the second wife of Alan Dershowitz, &nbsp;an American lawyer and legal scholar known for his scholarship of the U.S.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-carolyn-cohen></span>How old is Carolyn Cohen?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Carolyn was born in the United States, she has not shared her date of birth with the public, as it is not documented anywhere as of 2020.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-carolyn-cohen></span>How tall is Carolyn Cohen?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Carolyn stands at an average height, she has not shared her height with the public.
