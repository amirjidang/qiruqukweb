Although her ex-list includes some high profile names, none of them&nbsp;have come close to being 'the one' for the now 41-year-old former Pussycat Doll. Nicole has never been married, she is currently single, and is available for love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her ex-boyfriends come in all shapes and sizes, though the singer seems to prefer men who are in the music and film industry. That said, she's&nbsp;also gone out with pro athletes and a formula one driver. Nicole has appeared as a judge in The X Factor, The Masked Singer and Australia’s Got Talent, where she has sparked dating rumors by getting too close to some of the contestants. Although most of the onscreen flirting is for the show, here are some of the men Nicole has been involved with, both rumored and the ex-boyfriends.</p><h2 id=thom-evans-2019><span class=item-num>20 </span><span><strong>Thom Evans, 2019&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><p>Nicole and Thom met on X Factor: Celebrity. The Pussycat Dolls singer was at the time a judge on the show while Thom was a contestant and part of a trio known as Try Star. Nicole voted the group off in order to hide their romance. According to celebsnow.co.uk, Thom was recently in the company of another female when he was supposed to be with Nicole so we instantly right him off as a potential SO.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=thingamajig-2019><span class=item-num>19 </span><span><strong>Thingamajig, 2019</strong></span></h2><p>Goodhousekeeping.com explains that Thingamajig was also a contestant in another show where Nicole was a judge. If Nicole’s relationship with Thom is any indication, mixing work and pleasure is never a good idea. No matter how good their chemistry appeared to be, The Masked Singer contestant and Nicole’s relationship was already doomed for failure.</p><h2 id=hunky-male-contestant-number-one-2019><span class=item-num>18 </span><span><strong>Hunky Male Contestant Number One, 2019</strong></span></h2><p>As indicated on dailymail.co.uk, Nicole was also smitten by another contestant, this time from Australia’s Got Talent. Before she started swooning over the hunky male contestants on the show, the former Pussycat Doll publicly announced that she had broken up with Dimitrov, her previous boyfriend.</p><h2 id=australia-s-got-talent-contestant-number-two-august-2019><span class=item-num>17 </span><span><strong>Australia’s Got Talent Contestant Number Two, August 2019&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><p>If memory serves us right, work flings never lead to anything serious. T herefore, Nicole is better off staying away from these Aussie contestants. Even her fellow judge, Lucy Durak, joked with the singer on dailymail.co.uk about her search for an Australian man. Nicole appeared to be flirting with another contestant hence Lucy’s comments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=grigor-dimitrov-2016-2019><span class=item-num>16 </span><span><strong>Grigor Dimitrov, 2016-2019</strong></span></h2><p>Nicole began dating Bulgarian pro tennis player Grigor Dimitrov towards the end of 2015. This was one of Nicole’s few long relationships but unfortunately, the couple went their separate ways because they were too busy with their individual careers to commit to one another. Dimitrov admits on usweekly.com that Nicole was the one who was always traveling to meet him where he was, therefore we also do not think that this was the right man for Nicole.</p><h2 id=dj-calvin-harris-2016><span class=item-num>15 </span><span><strong>DJ&nbsp;Calvin Harris, 2016</strong></span></h2><p>While still in a relationship with Dimitrov, Nicole met with DJ Calvin Harris outside a nightclub so people assumed they had a thing. The singer denied the rumors as stated on marriedbiography.com and Dimitrov obviously did not pay any attention to the allegations because the two went on with their relationship and remained together for almost three years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matt-terry-2016><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><strong>Matt Terry, 2016&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><p>Nicole's fascination with Matt Terry, the winner of The X Factor 2016 also sparked dating rumors. During the final show, as indicated on marriedbiography.com, Matt lifted Nicole up in a hug then she also welcomed his advances by kissing him all over. Besides this being unprofessional, Matt was only&nbsp;23,&nbsp;which was very young for the superstar.</p><h2 id=ed-sheeran-august-2015><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>Ed Sheeran, August 2015</strong></span></h2><p>When Nicole and Hamilton parted ways, she tuned to Ed Sheeran’s music to help her heal as stated on famousfix.com. By some twist of fate, the two grew close to each other after Nicole confessed to Sheeran that his music had helped her get through her breakup. The two have gone on a date at Sheeran’s hometown but their relationship has never grown further than that. Their age difference could also have been a hindrance.</p><h2 id=pajtim-kasami-june-2015><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>Pajtim Kasami,&nbsp;</strong><strong>June 2015</strong></span></h2><p>Ranker.com reported that Swiss soccer player Pajtim Kasami and Nicole saw each other for two months in 2015. We are guessing that the two were unable to coordinate their schedules given they live in different countries so they decided to part ways before things became serious. However, if they had stayed together as Nicole did with Dimitrov, maybe things would have worked out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jay-z-2014><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><strong>Jay-Z, 2014</strong></span></h2><p>According to marriedbiography.com, Nicole and rapper Jay-Z had a fling in 2014. Jay-Z was married at the time, which makes him unavailable and a no-go for Nicole. In her 2016 album titled Lemonade, Jay-z's wife, Beyoncé Knowles talks about the affair and her choice to forgive her husband for his indiscretions.</p><h2 id=chris-brown-2012><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Chris Brown, 2012</strong></span></h2><p>Although R & B singer Chris Brown and Nicole denied ever having a thing as reported on marriedbiography.com, the two were cozy with each other at a nightclub in 2012. Nicole was at the time in an on and off relationship with Lewis Hamilton so it is safe to say that things would not have gone very far with Chris.</p><h2 id=steve-jones-2011><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Steve Jones, 2011</strong></span></h2><p>According to maieclaie.co.uk, people thought Nicole and Steve Jones were dating due to their chemistry together. At the time, Nicole had separated from Lewis Hamilton so it was easy to believe that the two were dating. The pair used to hold hands and flirt on set. Nicole also visited Steve at his home on several occasions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drake-2011><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Drake, 2011</strong></span></h2><p>Just after Nicole and Hamilton split, Nicole also spent some one on one time with rapper Drake. Theboxhouston.com confirms that the two were pretty close. They once had a romantic dinner at a restaurant in Hollywood. However, they never left the restaurant together to avoid any speculations in their relationship. Nicole left first then Drake followed.</p><h2 id=derek-hough-2010><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Derek Hough, 2010</strong></span></h2><p>This was another showmance that had people convinced that Nicole and her fellow Dancing With The Stars costar, Derek Hough were an item. Mtv.com says that Derek’s sister also thought the two were good together both on the show and away from the cameras. However, Nicole denied the rumors explaining that she was very much together with her then-boyfriend, Formula one driver, Lewis Hamilton.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lewis-hamilton-2008-2015><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Lewis Hamilton, 2008-2015</strong></span></h2><p>Nicole’s relationship with Lewis Hamilton is the longest known relationship the singer has&nbsp;had.&nbsp;Expess.co.uk states that the two met in 2007 at the MTV EMAs and had been in an on and off relationship for seven years. They finally called it quits, this time for good, in 2015. Apparently, Lewis’s relationship with his cars is far more important than that with his women.</p><h2 id=will-i-am-july-2008><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Will.I.Am, July 2008</strong></span></h2><p>Nicole and this former Black Eyed Peas member also had a fling in July 2008. Nicole defends herself on zimbio.com by saying that Will.I.Am is like a bother to her, however, other sources seem to believe the opposite especially after the pair made out at a nightclub in Los Angeles.</p><h2 id=dane-cook-october-2007><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Dane Cook, October 2007</strong></span></h2><p>For the most part, Nicole has been dating younger men. American standup comedian and actor Dane Cook is six years older than Nicole. Although his age seemed more appropriate for Nicole, the two never dated for long. They were together very briefly in October 2007. Other than the kiss they shared one night out, as disclosed by zimbio.com, there is no other indication that the two were dating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=talan-torriero-2005-2007><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Talan Torriero, 2005-2007&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><p>Talan Torrieo is famous for starring in the reality TV show Laguna Beach. He had relations with Nicole for two years from 2005 to 2007 as revealed by thesun.co.uk. Nicole was the one who ended the relationship in order to focus on her music career. She made it very clear that she had no time to commit to a relationship.</p><h2 id=nick-hexum-2000-2004><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Nick Hexum, 2000-2004</strong></span></h2><p>According to zimbio.com, Nicole met Nick Hexum at a concert in 2000. The relationship between the lead singer for Pussycat Dolls and the lead singer for 311 Rocker lasted for four years. The two were also engaged before they called their relationship off. Given their seven-year age difference, Nick was probably ready to settle down but Nicole was not.</p><h2 id=nick-cannon-1999-2000><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Nick Cannon, 1999-2000&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><p>Many people did not know that Nicole had a relationship with Cannon until he admitted it in an interview in 2014. Thesun.co.uk continued to explain that Cannon was asked to give out the names of famous women he had had been with so he gave out a list of names and Nicole’s name happened to be one of them. Nicole has never spoken of the relationship neither has she ever denied it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources:&nbsp;Thesun, Mtv, usweekly,&nbsp;dailymail,&nbsp;Goodhousekeeping,&nbsp;celebsnow.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhpaWWTmrmmroymnKdlnp6wsLjEZqqcoJWnx6q6xp6pZqCRqHqlrdOem2avmKR6uLHRnmSnp6RitLC7w2acp6elnLVuss6rZKGdomQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f20-celeb-men-nicole-scherzinger-has-dated-who-were-not-good-enough-for-her.html&text=20%20Celeb%20Men%20Nicole%20Scherzinger%20Has%20Dated%20%28Who%20Were%20Not%20Good%20Enough%20For%20Her%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f20-celeb-men-nicole-scherzinger-has-dated-who-were-not-good-enough-for-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f20-celeb-men-nicole-scherzinger-has-dated-who-were-not-good-enough-for-her.html&title=20%20Celeb%20Men%20Nicole%20Scherzinger%20Has%20Dated%20%28Who%20Were%20Not%20Good%20Enough%20For%20Her%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f20-celeb-men-nicole-scherzinger-has-dated-who-were-not-good-enough-for-her.html&title=20%20Celeb%20Men%20Nicole%20Scherzinger%20Has%20Dated%20%28Who%20Were%20Not%20Good%20Enough%20For%20Her%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f20-celeb-men-nicole-scherzinger-has-dated-who-were-not-good-enough-for-her.html&title=20%20Celeb%20Men%20Nicole%20Scherzinger%20Has%20Dated%20%28Who%20Were%20Not%20Good%20Enough%20For%20Her%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f20-celeb-men-nicole-scherzinger-has-dated-who-were-not-good-enough-for-her.html&description=20%20Celeb%20Men%20Nicole%20Scherzinger%20Has%20Dated%20%28Who%20Were%20Not%20Good%20Enough%20For%20Her%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./20-rules-henry-cavill-had-to-follow-to-become-superman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 Rules Henry Cavill Had To Follow To Become Superman">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./celebrities-guys-find-attractive.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="13 Female Celebs Who Men Like (And 12 That Women Like)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
