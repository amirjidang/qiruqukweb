His Canadian background makes him a down-to-earth singer, even though he and his wife Hailey Bieber have a ton of money between them. As Justin wrote in an Instagram post in 2020, "I came from a small town in Stratford Ontario Canada. I didn’t have material things and was never motivated by money or fame I just loved music."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While fans are familiar with his parents Pattie Mallette and Jeremy Bieber, Justin Bieber also has several siblings. They seem to be a huge and important part of his life, and he seems to think about them all the time. But how do his stepsisters and stepbrother really feel about the career that he has and some of the trouble that he has gotten into?</p><h2 id=how-many-siblings-does-justin-bieber-have>How Many Siblings Does Justin Bieber Have?</h2><p>Justin Bieber's family has long been a source of fascination for fans. And now that Hailey Bieber has become part of his family, everyone wonders <a href=#>whether Jeremy Bieber and Hailey Bieber get along</a>. There are similar questions about Hailey's relationship with Justin's mom Pattie. While a lot has been written about Justin's parents, not as much is known about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin's four stepsiblings</a>.</p><p>According to E! News, the singer has two stepsisters from his father Jeremy's relationship with Chelsey Rebelo: Bay Bieber and Allie Rebelo. Jeremy and Chelsey got married in 2018. Bay was born in August 2018. Chelsey shares Allie with a previous partner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/7-3.png><p>Jeremy also dated Erin Wagner for a long time.

While not every detail of their lives has been shared, it's clear that they are a part of his life. The Huffington Post reported in 2016 that Justin invited his younger brother Jaxon to the Grammys, which must have been fun for both of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/justin-bieber.jpg><p>After marrying Hailey, Justin was interviewed by SiriusXM Hits 1 on 1 and he said that being with Hailey has made him care about family more. He said, “Prioritising my family [has been helpful] … I never had a consistent family life. It was kind of all over the place growing up. So, finally having that predictability and reliability [with my wife Hailey], someone who I love and trust, has been so monumental.”</p><h2 id=what-have-justin-bieber-39-s-siblings-said-about-his-fame>What Have Justin Bieber's Siblings Said About His Fame?</h2><p>It seems like it would be tough to have a superstar like Justin Bieber as a sibling or stepsibling because of the magnitude of his fame. Does the fact that everyone in the world knows his name bother his family? Do they wish that he was living a regular life? And are they upset about some of the mistakes that Justin has made over the years?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Justin Bieber Has Been Presumed Dead Multiple Times, Here's The Truth About The Harmful Hoax</a></span></p><p>Although Justin is in the news all the time, it doesn't seem that his siblings have even given interviews about him. Maybe they don't want to talk to the media. Or maybe they don't want to create even more headlines since he has been written about so much.</p><p>According to E! News, Justin was arrested for several things in 2014. E! News said the trouble included "suspicion of drunk driving, drag racing, driving without a valid license and resisting arrest." TMZ reported that he also vandalized a house that same year. In the years that have passed since then, Justin has said that he was having a difficult time and he has grown since those experiences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/justin-bieber-jazmyn-bieber.jpg><p>It's also possible that Justin Bieber's siblings see him as a totally regular person. This is definitely the vibe that Justin and Hailey put out into the world, even though of course they do live privileged lives.</p><p>Hailey was interviewed by The Wall Street Journal Magazine in 2022 and she said, “Behind closed doors, we’re two really normal people that just have not-normal lifestyles and careers. I think given the magnitude of Justin’s career, he’s a very normal person, and I don’t think that always happens.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/justin-bieber-jazmyn-bieber-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have been rumors that Justin Bieber's sisters are bigger fans of Selena Gomez than Hailey Bieber's.

According to Entertainment Weekly, his stepsister Jazymn and stepbrother Jaxon came to see Hotel Transylvania at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2012.</p><p>Gomez said to Entertainment Weekly, “They loved it. They enjoyed it. We lost some shoes, and they got really excited, but it was good."</p><p>It's great that Justin Bieber tries to involve his siblings in his famous lifestyle.
