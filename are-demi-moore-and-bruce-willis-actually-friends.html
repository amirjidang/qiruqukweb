Willis and Moore had three daughters after getting married: Rumer in 1988, Scout in 1991, and Tallulah in 1994. In June 1998, the ex-couple made their separation official. They filed for divorce in October 2000, and it became official the same day. Later that year, Willis acknowledged he was unsure of the precise because of their marriage's problems.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Every couple encounters difficulties, and so did Demi and Bruce. They had a Las Vegas wedding in November 1987, just after four months of knowing each other. The journey of their 12-year marriage was rocky but that did not stop them from being good co-parents.</p><h2 id=bruce-willis-and-demi-moore-stayed-friends-post-divorce>Bruce Willis And Demi Moore Stayed Friends Post-Divorce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bruce-willis-and-wife-emma.jpg><p>In Moore's revealing 2019 memoir, Inside Out, she shared her first impression of Willis by stating: "I'd never encountered treatment like this before. Bruce was so gallant -- a real gentleman in his own boisterous way."</p><p>In the years following their divorce, it is evident that Bruce and Demi have upheld their commitment to continuing to raise their children together. Despite Bruce's 2009 marriage to model Emma Hering, he and Demi continued to try to give Rumer and her siblings a sense of family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I still love Demi.

Our friendship continues. The institution has been set aside. It’s difficult to live your life and marriage under a magnifying glass, which is what happens to movie star couples,” he added.</p><p>Moore and Willis even helped one another out in their new love lives. At Charlie's Angels 2 - Full Throttle premiere in 2003, Moore and all three of her daughters posed with both Willis and Kutcher, causing controversy. Later, the G.I.
