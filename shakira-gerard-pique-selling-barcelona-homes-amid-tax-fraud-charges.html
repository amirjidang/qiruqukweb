And now that Shakira is preparing to fight a legal battle again, it’s been reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she and her ex-partner Gerard Pique are planning to sell the multiple properties</a> they own in Barcelona.</p><p>This includes a luxe property in the heart of Barcelona with over 3,000 square feet of living. It comes with amenities like a gym, swimming pool, and paddle tennis court. The second property the pair purchased with the intention of renovating, but that never happened, as they spit occurred soon after.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Shakira-Wants-To-Buy-Miami-Mansion-That-Can-Only-Be-Reached-By-Helicopter-.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Shakira Wants To Buy Mansion That Can Only Be Reached By Helicopter</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Now that she's relocating to Miami, Shakira clearly wants the maximum privacy.</span><p>It’s unclear if the former couple’s decision to sell their homes are due to Shakira’s ongoing financial crimes (as she may have to pay up millions in back due taxes), or if it’s part of the couple’s break-up, as the singer relocated to the U.S. with their kids earlier this year. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gerard apparently didn’t challenge Shakira’s request</a> to move their sons abroad.</p><p>Shakira and Gerard reportedly want to sell the homes quickly and discreetly. It’s unknown how much they’re asking for, but they may get less than they’re hoping, if their main goal is to make the sales go fast.</p><p>Shakira, 46, is being <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">accused of evading approximately $7.1 million</a> in taxes in 2018. It’s been alleged that Shakira took advantage of an offshore company situated in a tax haven to circumvent the tax liability. The case was initiated in July, but prosecutors chose not to disclose it publicly until this week. As of now, it appears there has no schedule set for the singer's trial.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shakira relocated to Miami, Florida earlier this year with her two sons, following the breakdown of her relationship with Gerard Pique (who allegedly had an affair with a younger woman, leading to their split).</p><p>Interestingly, the singer’s team gave a statement to the media saying they have not received any information regarding the new charges, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters </a><a href=#>confirms</a>. Nevertheless, Spanish authorities doubled down on the reports, saying Shakira was indeed informed on Tuesday when the charges were filed.</p><p>Unfortunately, this isn’t the only tax fraud charges Shakira has faced. She’s currently navigating separate charges that were brought forth last year. In fact, she’s due to appear in court in Barcelona on November 20 to deal with the first tax evasion case, which alleges she avoided paying $15.4 million USD in taxes to the Spanish government.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to prosecutors, Shakira is liable for these taxes in Spain because she resided in Barcelona for the majority of the two-year period from 2012 to 2014 (she used to live their full-time with Pique and their sons). However, Shakira contends that her official residence during that time was in the Bahamas, so she believes the taxes aren’t owed.</p><p>Last September, it was reported that <a href=#>Shakira could face a $26 million fine</a> as well as jail time, if the court finds her guilty.</p><p>Despite the severity of the alleged financial crimes, Shakira has consistently refuted the accusations and expressed a positive outlook regarding the charges in public. “I’ve paid everything they claimed I owed, even before they filed a lawsuit. So as of today, I owe zero to them,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told Elle of the situation.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It is well known that the Spanish tax authorities do this often not only with celebrities like me," she went on. “It also happens unjustly to the regular taxpayer. It’s just their style.” Shakira added, “But I’m confident that I have enough proof to support my case and that justice will prevail in my favor.”</p><p>So far, the “Hips Don’t Lie” vocalist hasn’t commented on the most recent charges.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKCRoLazrYygnKuZopl6sbXQrpxmq5Whuaq6xmaZmqqTmrmwusBmn6illah6ornInWStmahis7Ot1J1knKCRp7Smv44%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fshakira-gerard-pique-selling-barcelona-homes-amid-tax-fraud-charges.html&text=Shakira%20%26amp%3b%20Gerard%20Pique%20Must%20Sell%20Barcelona%20Estates%20As%20Shes%20Charged%20With%20Tax%20Fraud%20Again&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshakira-gerard-pique-selling-barcelona-homes-amid-tax-fraud-charges.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshakira-gerard-pique-selling-barcelona-homes-amid-tax-fraud-charges.html&title=Shakira%20%26amp%3b%20Gerard%20Pique%20Must%20Sell%20Barcelona%20Estates%20As%20Shes%20Charged%20With%20Tax%20Fraud%20Again" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fshakira-gerard-pique-selling-barcelona-homes-amid-tax-fraud-charges.html&title=Shakira%20%26amp%3b%20Gerard%20Pique%20Must%20Sell%20Barcelona%20Estates%20As%20Shes%20Charged%20With%20Tax%20Fraud%20Again" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fshakira-gerard-pique-selling-barcelona-homes-amid-tax-fraud-charges.html&title=Shakira%20%26amp%3b%20Gerard%20Pique%20Must%20Sell%20Barcelona%20Estates%20As%20Shes%20Charged%20With%20Tax%20Fraud%20Again" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshakira-gerard-pique-selling-barcelona-homes-amid-tax-fraud-charges.html&description=Shakira%20%26amp%3b%20Gerard%20Pique%20Must%20Sell%20Barcelona%20Estates%20As%20Shes%20Charged%20With%20Tax%20Fraud%20Again" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sheldon-dutes-bio-wiki-age-wife-parents-salary-net-worth-wisn-12-height-and-college-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sheldon Dutes Bio, Wiki, Age, Wife, Parents, Salary, Net Worth, WISN 12, Height and College">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ryan-reynolds-says-his-kids-have-pride-for-their-dual-citizenships.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ryan Reynolds Says His Kids Have 'Pride' for Their Dual Citizenships">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
