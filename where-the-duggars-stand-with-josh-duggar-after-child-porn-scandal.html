Josh <a href=#>apologized for his actions</a> at the time, revealing that he’d previously sought counseling for his “wrongdoings” as a teen.</p><p>“Twelve years ago, as a young teenager, I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret,” Josh wrote via the family’s Facebook account in May 2015. “I hurt others, including my family and close friends.”</p><p>The incident — <a href=#>which involved four of Josh’s sisters</a> — and <a href=#>its resurfaced story</a> led to the Duggars reexamining their dynamic. In April 2021, <a href=#><strong>Jinger Duggar</strong></a> exclusively <a href=#>told Us Weekly</a> that despite the pain that Josh brought to the group, everyone came out stronger.</p><p>“Our family was way closer because of that, <a href=#>and in spite of that</a>, I guess you’d say. I will never forget how I felt in that moment,” Jinger said at the time. “And I think even everything that happens in our lives — because we’re in the public eye — it makes it more challenging because then it’s not just dealing with these things inwardly, but you have to give an answer to the world. That makes it a much tougher thing to walk through.”</p><p>Later that month, Josh again turned heads when he was <a href=#>arrested in Arkansas</a> for allegedly receiving and possessing child pornography. His family was put through the wringer once more, with <a href=#>multiple siblings speaking out about the case</a>.</p><p>“The recent accusations brought against Josh sadden us to our core. We have not wanted to be hasty in making any statements while trying to process the news ourselves,” <a href=#><strong>Joy-Anna Duggar</strong></a> and her husband, <strong>Austin Forsyth</strong>, said in a statement via their Instagram Stories in May 2021. “We are especially heartbroken by the reality that there are children in the world being harmed and exploited. <a href=#>We ask for prayer for all those involved</a> and it is our continued prayer that the truth comes to light.”</p><p>In December 2021, Josh was convicted of <a href=#>two counts of receiving and possessing child pornography</a>. He was sentenced in May 2022 to 151 months, <a href=#>which equates to a little over 12 years</a>, in prison for his crimes.</p><p>“This trial has felt more like a funeral than anything else,” sister <a href=#><strong>Jill Duggar</strong></a> said <a href=#>in a statement</a> on her and husband <a href=#><strong>Derick Dillard</strong></a>’s blog following <a href=#>the conclusion of the trial</a>.</p><p>Josh’s mom, however, continued to fight for her son to be released. In a letter obtained by the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> in May 2022, Michelle requested leniency when it came to Josh’s sentencing, arguing that he is a good man deep down.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[Josh] has friends and family who will love and support him in his abilities to succeed as a husband, father, business owner, and man both now and in the future,” she wrote, noting that she still offers her “continued love and encouragement to Joshua.” Michelle added: “We ask that he would be reunited with his wife and family in a timely manner.”</p><p>Scroll down to see where <a href=#>Josh stands with the rest of the Duggar family</a>:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkxKmx0Z5kraCVYrG2s8aaqaxlo6mur7CMsKCtoF2fvLS0jJ2soJ%2BRp3qistOeqWabmJ65pXnPqKmnZaOYrq%2BwwKVm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhere-the-duggars-stand-with-josh-duggar-after-child-porn-scandal.html&text=Where%20the%20Duggars%20Stand%20With%20Josh%20Duggar%20After%20Child%20Porn%20Scandal&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-the-duggars-stand-with-josh-duggar-after-child-porn-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-the-duggars-stand-with-josh-duggar-after-child-porn-scandal.html&title=Where%20the%20Duggars%20Stand%20With%20Josh%20Duggar%20After%20Child%20Porn%20Scandal" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhere-the-duggars-stand-with-josh-duggar-after-child-porn-scandal.html&title=Where%20the%20Duggars%20Stand%20With%20Josh%20Duggar%20After%20Child%20Porn%20Scandal" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-the-duggars-stand-with-josh-duggar-after-child-porn-scandal.html&title=Where%20the%20Duggars%20Stand%20With%20Josh%20Duggar%20After%20Child%20Porn%20Scandal" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-the-duggars-stand-with-josh-duggar-after-child-porn-scandal.html&description=Where%20the%20Duggars%20Stand%20With%20Josh%20Duggar%20After%20Child%20Porn%20Scandal" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./robert-redford-young.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Actor, Director &amp;amp; Producer Robert Redford Young?
