Vanna White is an American TV host who rose to fame as the host of NBC’s hit game show Wheel of Fortune.</p><p>She has had several film and TV roles, but her role as the show’s “letter turner” made her a household name.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Fans and viewers of her show may enjoy her work, but they likely have no idea if she is married or has children.</p><p>The video game celebrity is the mother of two children, and her offspring resembles her closely; both children have inherited their mother’s facial expressions and physical characteristics.</p><p>She brought up her kids all alone when they were very young. She got divorced from her child’s father. So here we get to know about Vanna White Children in detail;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Vanna White Children, Daughter Gigi Santo Pietro</strong></h2><p>The couple welcomed their second child, <a href=#>Gigi</a>, on July 2, 1997. She was their second child overall. After a few years, Vanna fans became familiar with her children because they frequently appeared alongside their mother on Wheel of Fortune.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2003, Vanna distributed photographs that she had taken of her two children when they were filming the game show. Gigi is a young woman with a lot of talent who works in a tattoo shop in Huntington Beach, California.&nbsp;</p><p>Gigi Santo Pietro graduated from the Tisch School of the Arts in New York City. She is interested in drawing and photography, in addition to the art of tattooing, which is her primary passion.</p><p>Vanna makes up for it with her countless postings on Instagram, letting her admirers know how proud she is of her only daughter, Gigi. The latter lives a somewhat private life and leaves a minimal impact on social media.</p><p>&nbsp;The TV celebrity captioned cute throwback pictures of her daughter Gigi with the phrase, “to my sweet girl<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> @gigisantopietro</a> who I love and adore with all my heart.&nbsp;</p><p>#happynationaldaughtersday.” And early in the year 2020, while Vanna was being isolated, Gigi visited her mother to check on how she was doing while she was quarantined, and she even gave her a manicure while there. How sweet!</p><p>She has Tattoo Company<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> @lincolntattoocompany</a>; she used to create people’s favorite tattoos on their favorite places and earn money and love.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Vanna White Children, Son Nicholas Santo Pietro</strong></h2><p>White and her first child and son, <a href=#>Nikko</a>, have a powerful bond, as seen by the fact that they constantly post images of themselves together on various social media platforms.</p><p>Participating in charitable events for different causes is one way in which they strengthen their bonds with one another.</p><p>Nikko was born on June 10, 1994, and attended Oregon State University and the University of Arizona before graduating from the former.</p><p>Both he and his mother get a kick out of exploring new places together and documenting their exploits, such as trekking in Hawaii, on various social media platforms.</p><p>Nikko was in a <a href=#>relationship</a> with a Hare Krishna monk named Jaycee Akinsanya in 2013, and their involvement garnered much media attention.</p><p>According to the Daily Mail, Nikko was quoted as saying at the time, “<strong>Jaycee and I have a particular friendship</strong>.”</p><p>&nbsp;“This is the most intimate interaction I’ve ever had with another person. It is spiritual and amazing, and there is chemistry between you; yet, if there is sex, that is fine with me. It makes no difference!”&nbsp;</p><p>He described his relationship as “close,” although he remained unsure about his sexual orientation. I’ve only had one girlfriend, and I’ve never been serious with a guy.</p><p>“<strong>All that matters is that we are with each other, and we can express our love for one another</strong>,” he explained. “<strong>Gay? It is not impossible. After meeting him, he further mentioned that his mother and father had “liked” Jaycee</strong>.</p><p>In the meantime, there is no denying the mother-son bond between Vanna and Nikko. She is always gushing about him on social media, such as in a post she made in September of last year that showed infant pictures of Nikko and the remark, “<strong>Happy #nationalsonsday to my sweet and loving son <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@nikkoshow</a>.” I adore you to pieces!</strong>“</p><p>Professionally he is a chief and used different cook cuisines.&nbsp;</p><p>He has a girlfriend and used to share his pictures with his girlfriend on social media, such as he writes with images.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;My love Codie and me camping at Taum Sauk Mountain 🥰 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@codie_coyote</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Vanna White Used to Spent Time with Her Childre</strong>n</h2><p>We are all aware that the actress from Double Dragon (she’s made several cameo appearances and even starred in the 1988 TV movie Goddess of Love) spends much of her free time with her boyfriend, John.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, she also tries to spend quality time with her children and maintains a healthy balance between the two relationships. Vanna commemorated her twenty-first birthday in June of 2020 by spending time with her son and her daughter-in-law, Gigi.</p><p>In addition, she used her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram account</a> to post images of herself with her children under the caption, “Hanging with my kids in the city! There’s nothing better! #familybond #love</p><p>Vanna White’s children provide her with a never-ending supply of happiness; she treasures the times when they can visit her, and she was overjoyed while she was in quarantine when Gigi came by and painted her nails a shade of pink.&nbsp;</p><p>The ecstatic mother immediately rushed to Instagram to post, Happy 24th Birthday to my unique, beautiful, and talented daughter Gigi! <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@gigisantopietro</a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;During the pandemic, the woman who was a mother to two children remained unharmed and in good health. She has spent many years showing her children how to live joyful lives.</p><p>She used to admire her children differently as she says that her kids have another girl with city side test and a boy with countryside tasting.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Does Vanna White Have Children?</strong></h2><p>Yes, she has two children, Gigi and Nicholas.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How Many Children Does Vanna White have?</strong></h2><p>She has two children, Gigi and Nicholas.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>So we have gotten all the possible details about Vanna White’s Children; her children are so talented and beautiful.&nbsp;</p><p>They both have different interests in life. Vanna White’s daughter is a tattoo master with her own company, and Vanna White’s son is a master chief with a variety of her cuisine and company to serve people with his magic food.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDCwKelmmWnnba1sYycn6KklKeyr3s%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fvanna-white-children.html&text=Vanna%20White%20Children%2c%20Gigi%2c%20And%20Nicholas%2c%20All%20You%20Want%20To%20Know&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvanna-white-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvanna-white-children.html&title=Vanna%20White%20Children%2c%20Gigi%2c%20And%20Nicholas%2c%20All%20You%20Want%20To%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fvanna-white-children.html&title=Vanna%20White%20Children%2c%20Gigi%2c%20And%20Nicholas%2c%20All%20You%20Want%20To%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fvanna-white-children.html&title=Vanna%20White%20Children%2c%20Gigi%2c%20And%20Nicholas%2c%20All%20You%20Want%20To%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvanna-white-children.html&description=Vanna%20White%20Children%2c%20Gigi%2c%20And%20Nicholas%2c%20All%20You%20Want%20To%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./friends-jennifer-aniston-sarah-jessica-parker-celebrity-feud.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Was Jennifer Aniston Forced Into A Rivalry With Sarah Jessica Parker While On Friends?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tricia-evasco-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-601546-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tricia Evasco Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
