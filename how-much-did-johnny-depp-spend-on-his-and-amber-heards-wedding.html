The two have even slammed each other with lawsuits, changing the narrative repeatedly and making us wonder just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what exactly led to their quick divorce?</a> Clearly, their marriage was far from a happy one, but their wedding day pictures certainly paint a different picture. Johnny Depp seemingly went to great lengths to ensure that his wedding looked as “picture-perfect” as possible, in hopes of keeping the truth behind closed doors.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnny Depp’s 10 Biggest Paychecks (& How Much He Got)</a></span></p><h2 id=depp-spends-big-on-his-wedding-day>Depp Spends Big On His Wedding Day</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By Johnny Depp being a big-time celebrity, it’s not surprising that he spends only the best. Many would’ve thought he would’ve spoiled his young wife Amber Heard with all his riches on their special day, but that wasn’t the case. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Depp and Heard marital problems started long before abuse allegations</a>, they began on the very day they wed. Amber Heard has since revealed that there was an excessive amount of drugs and alcohol present at the festivities after the wedding ceremony. During court hearings, the wedding schedule read as, “Seven pm, rehearsal dinner, after dance party and drugs and music.” According to sources, The Pirates of the Caribbean actor “acknowledged there were drugs throughout the celebrations but somehow wasn’t made aware of the explicit memo.” That speaks volumes. Additionally, Heard even revealed that she and Johnny Depp fought over his extreme drug use. It’s not clear what the total costs were on how much Johnny Depp spent on the wedding, but most of his money went majorly to the large supply of drugs at the ceremony. That’s a great way to start a marriage, Depp.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Joe Rogan And Macaulay Culkin Believe Happened To Johnny Depp</a></span></p><h2 id=johnny-depp-has-a-history-of-poor-spending-habits>Johnny Depp Has A History Of Poor Spending Habits</h2><p>Many of the details revealed during Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s court proceedings shocked fans. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explosive fights between the couple and Depp’s abusive behavior</a> toward his now ex-wife were difficult details to swallow. Though, those aren’t the only shocking details revealed. In particular, Johnny Depp’s bad spending habits have come to light. Sources have noted that Johnny Depp spends like crazy when it comes to wine, his lavish lifestyle, and especially women.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Rolling Stone magazine, the star made $650 million off films alone, due in large part to his role as Jack Sparrow in the huge Disney film franchise The Pirates of the Caribbean. Though, that total has since dwindled. Among a number of reasons, Depp’s biggest financial issues seemed to have stemmed from his relationships. Micky reports that Johnny Depp once paid his ex-girlfriend Vanessa Paradis $127 million dollars after they split. They weren’t even married! Additionally, he made a settlement agreement with Heard that left her with $7 million dollars. Rather than taking the money as his ex Paradis had done, Heard instead donated the money to charity. Apparently, Johnny Depp needs to stay away from high-profile relationships and women in general.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's The Most Ridiculous Thing Johnny Depp Spent $3 Million On</a></span></p><h2 id=depp-s-issues-with-alcohol>Depp’s Issues With Alcohol</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Johnny Depp obviously lives an extremely lavish lifestyle but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he needs to learn how to budget his money</a>. The 57-year-old clearly loves making hefty purchases and buys the most outlandish of items. Mandel once reported that the actor compulsive spends $2 million a month. That number should at least be cut in half. Most of his excessive spending is also due to his drinking issues.</p><p>During his marriage to Amber Heard, Depp was said to have explosive outbursts that were a frequent result of his drug and alcohol intake. The Sun even reported one of Heard’s statements made during the courting hearings in London, where the actress recalled: “Depp drunk a lot of champagne early in one morning.” Additionally, it was disclosed that Depp “downed a pint of wine for breakfast.” The Pirates of the Caribbean actor has even admitted to having a bit of a drinking issue. During a legal battle between him and his former managers’ company, The Management Group, a statement was made about Depp’s own financial ruin being due to his $30,000 spent on booze. The Tourist actor, seemingly sarcastic, countered that “It’s insulting to say that I spent $30,000 on wine. Because it was far more.” Did he know at the time that the statement alone wasn’t helping his case? Depp’s further admittance during his martial legal battle with ex-wife Amber Heard certainly didn’t help his case, either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the laundry list of expenses Depp racks up in a month, it’s quite possible that the actor spent millions on the wedding. The 57-year-old is a compulsive spender and knows very little about budgeting his money, especially when it comes to drugs and alcohol.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Things Johnny Depp's Friends And Former Lovers Have Said About Him</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1lmqS1r7rYZpueqKBiwLGxzZ1kqKZdnba0ecCnm2aZnZeys3nHnpirnKNixKaww6KloGc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-did-johnny-depp-spend-on-his-and-amber-heards-wedding.html&text=How%20Much%20Did%20Johnny%20Depp%20Spend%20On%20His%20And%20Amber%20Heard%27s%20Wedding%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-did-johnny-depp-spend-on-his-and-amber-heards-wedding.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-did-johnny-depp-spend-on-his-and-amber-heards-wedding.html&title=How%20Much%20Did%20Johnny%20Depp%20Spend%20On%20His%20And%20Amber%20Heard%27s%20Wedding%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-much-did-johnny-depp-spend-on-his-and-amber-heards-wedding.html&title=How%20Much%20Did%20Johnny%20Depp%20Spend%20On%20His%20And%20Amber%20Heard%27s%20Wedding%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-did-johnny-depp-spend-on-his-and-amber-heards-wedding.html&title=How%20Much%20Did%20Johnny%20Depp%20Spend%20On%20His%20And%20Amber%20Heard%27s%20Wedding%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-did-johnny-depp-spend-on-his-and-amber-heards-wedding.html&description=How%20Much%20Did%20Johnny%20Depp%20Spend%20On%20His%20And%20Amber%20Heard%27s%20Wedding%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-taylor-denise-schabusiness-on-facebook-and-instagram-242362-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Taylor Denise Schabusiness On Facebook And Instagram?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-fefe-dobson-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Fefe Dobson Transcended An Endless Barrage Of Hate And Disappointment During Her Career">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
