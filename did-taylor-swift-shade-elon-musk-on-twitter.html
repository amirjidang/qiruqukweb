After all, he did so with <a href=#><strong>Cameron Diaz</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Amber Heard</strong></a>, and Grimes. Therefore, taking a shot at <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a> would not seem like a farfetched idea to Musk. And take a shot, albeit a bizarre one, he did.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Elon Musk And Mark Zuckerberg's Relationship Is Confusing And Contentious, Here's Why The Billionaires Aren't Exactly Friends</a></span></p><p>Before the world was aware that Swift and Joe Alwyn had broken up, <a href=#>likely from Swift's overwhelming fame</a>, it looked like they were on the road to getting married. The Purple Haze singer was not seen spotted out with other male celebrities, and she certainly was not dating anyone that the public was aware of. Yet, it was during this time that Musk thought he had a chance with Swift. As such, Musk began peacocking to see if he could get attention. And attention he got, but likely not the kind Musk had anticipated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elon-musk-sent-several-flattering-tweets-taylor-swift-39-s-direction>Elon Musk Sent Several Flattering Tweets Taylor Swift's Direction</h2><p>Mid-March 2023 was a big time for Swift. She was kicking off her Eras tour to sold-out crowds across the nation and working on re-recording her albums.</p><p>After the old albums were essentially stolen by Scooter Braun, a brilliant <a href=#>suggestion came from Kelly Clarkson</a> that helped Swift see she could get back control of her music and <a href=#>make Swift a great deal of money</a> by re-recording what had been taken.</p><p>It was also during this time that Musk began his hand at testing the waters to see if he had a shot with the Red singer in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">series of tweets that many found difficult to follow</a>.</p><p>On the opening night of Swift's tour, Dogecoin creator, Billy Markus started off a tweet that was supposed to get the goat of Swifties. However, he got much more than he bargained for when none other than Musk jumped into the conversation and took the string to a whole new level in a matter of moments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/elon-musk-smiling-with-his-thumbs-up.jpg><p>"Taylor Swift rules and if you disagree youâ€™ll be kicked off the internet Iâ€™m pretty sure," Markus wrote.</p><p>The response from Musk read, "Her limbic resonance skill is exceptional."</p><p>While Markus' followers as well as Swifties were working on trying to figure out what Musk meant by his tweet, shortly thereafter, he tweeted again. This time it was to a collage of photos that Swift had posted from her opening night of the tour. The response was a single lit cigarette emoji.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Really Happened Between Elon Musk And Talulah Riley And Are They Still Close After Divorcing Twice?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many believed that this was Musk's way of letting Swift know that he thought she was "smoking hot." A follower even put the question out into the Twitterverse, asking, "You guys think they make a cute couple?" Musk surprisingly responded, even if it was just with a laughing/crying emoji.</p><p>This was a lot for Swift's fans to take in, in a short time. And they waited, along with Musk with bated breath to see what the Anti-Hero singer's response would be. Her response was deafening.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-spoke-volumes-with-twitter-silence>Taylor Swift Spoke Volumes With Twitter Silence</h2><p>It needs to be remembered that Swift was, at least publicly, still in a relationship with Alwyn when these tweets are being circulated. And while she could have had some witty response to the Boring Company owner, the I Knew You Were Trouble singer gave a response that spoke volumes, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which was nothing but silence</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps this was Swift's way of letting Musk know that the "state of deep emotional and physiological connection between two people" Musk was referring to in his original tweet was never, ever, ever going to happen. Maybe she simply did not have time to respond given that Swift was busy with the tour. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">But that did not stop Swifties from responding for her</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Do Taylor Swift's Parents Care About Who She's Dating?

Another user said, "No. No. Nope."</p><p>"Ok. That's creeper weird, Elon," a third Twitter user commented. "If this another way of saying you think you and her would vibe well?"</p><p>Between the silence from Swift and the negative comments received from followers, Musk escalated things to a whole new level. And this level, while effective as a schoolboy who throws dirt on a girl her likes, only made Swift's fans more upset at Musk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elon-musk-threw-a-twitter-tantrum-after-being-rebuffed>Elon Musk Threw A Twitter Tantrum After Being Rebuffed</h2><p>After the tweets he made in March did not go as planned, Musk took a moment to shake off what had happened. But when he came back, Musk came back swinging with a Twitter tantrum, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posting a picture of Swift and Napoleon Dynamite side by side</a>, with the comment, "When you realize Taylor Swift is actually Napoleon Dynamite in drag."</p><p>Needless to say, fans came out in droves to express their disgust with Musk and his tweet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/elon-musk-looking-unsure.jpg><p>"Flattery failed so now we're onto negging," one Reddit user said. Another user stated, "Dude, she still isn't going to date you."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Reeks of misogyny," a third Reddit user commented. "'She didn't pay attention to me, now I gotta insult her!' What a loser."</p><p>If it was truly Musk's intention to get Swift's attention to gain her affection, it obviously did not work. All it did was receive a negative response from Swift's fans. And for anyone who is in the know, once on the Swifties' bad side, always on the Swifties' bad side.</p><p>As such, in their eyes, Musk has no way of ever coming back from these tweets, but maybe Swift will write a song about it. Only time will tell.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBbr%2FHmpueZZWhvK95zK6qpGWfo3q1w8itq56qXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-taylor-swift-shade-elon-musk-on-twitter.html&text=Taylor%20Swift%20May%20Have%20Shaded%20Elon%20Musk%2c%20And%20He%20Wasn%27t%20Happy%20About%20It&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-taylor-swift-shade-elon-musk-on-twitter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-taylor-swift-shade-elon-musk-on-twitter.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20May%20Have%20Shaded%20Elon%20Musk%2c%20And%20He%20Wasn%27t%20Happy%20About%20It" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-taylor-swift-shade-elon-musk-on-twitter.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20May%20Have%20Shaded%20Elon%20Musk%2c%20And%20He%20Wasn%27t%20Happy%20About%20It" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-taylor-swift-shade-elon-musk-on-twitter.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20May%20Have%20Shaded%20Elon%20Musk%2c%20And%20He%20Wasn%27t%20Happy%20About%20It" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-taylor-swift-shade-elon-musk-on-twitter.html&description=Taylor%20Swift%20May%20Have%20Shaded%20Elon%20Musk%2c%20And%20He%20Wasn%27t%20Happy%20About%20It" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./highest-paid-football-coaches.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Highest Paid Coaches In Football, Ranked">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sydney-sweeney-parents-where-do-dad-scott-sweeney-and-mom-lisa-mudd-sweeney-live.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sydney Sweeney Parents: Where Do Dad Scott Sweeney and Mom Lisa Mudd Sweeney Live?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
