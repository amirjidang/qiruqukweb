And so, celebrities shell out as much on a haircut as the average person makes in a week or even a month. Similarly, the world’s best hairstylists are in incredibly high demand, so they can afford to charge unearthly fees for their sought-after services.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Is it really obvious if a person spends thousands on a haircut as opposed to few dollars? Perhaps celebrity idolaters feel justified in paying an exorbitant price to have their hair cut by the same person who cuts the hair of today’s hottest A-list celebs, or they may even pay through the nose simply to have their hair cut in the style&nbsp;of their favourite celeb.&nbsp;When shame of Canada <a title="Justin Bieber Net Worth" href=#>Justin Bieber</a> cut off his Bieber bowl in 2011 it reportedly cost doll manufacturer The Bridge Direct Company $100,000 (as they had to change all their dolls' 'dos) and millions of teenage boys the world over were left with an outmoded look that they'd adapted to appeal to the heartthrob's female fanbase. Similarly, <a title="Rihanna Net Worth" href=#>Rihanna</a>'s increasingly bizarre hairstyles and <a title="Katy Perry Net Worth" href=#>Katy Perry</a>'s often outlandish hair colours see female fans shelling out hundreds to imitate their favorite stars' every hairdo whim. If you're really in the big leagues though, you can set the set the style instead of imitating it - and that's where the uber-expensive celebrity hairdressers come in. The following are the stylists behind some of the most expensive haircuts, ranked by the price they ask for a simple wash-cut-and-blow-dry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-oribe-400><b>10. Oribe $400</b></h2><p>via thewordygirl.com</p><p>This Cuban-born hairstylist has a legendary reputation, so he can charge as much as $400 for his services. He got his start as an assistant for hairstyling icon Garren when he opened his first salon in New York City at the Plaza Hotel. He has honed his skills over the years, and now Oribe cuts the hair of celebrities like <a title="Jennifer Lopez Net Worth" href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a>.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-serge-normant-500><b>9.

He routinely shows off his skills for high profile fashion shoots - but if the average person wants a cut from Normant they'll have to put down $500 at one of the John Frieda Salons in either New York or Los Angeles.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-chris-mcmillan-600><b>8.

Hershberger became famous for cutting and shaping Meg Ryan’s iconic short, blonde locks. Tom Cruise and Hilary Clinton are clients of Hershberger, too.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-frederic-fekkai-750><b>6. Frederic Fekkai $750</b></h2><p>via nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b>Fekkai made a lot of people balk when he started charging $300 for a cut way back in the late ‘90s, but now the price has more than doubled. While inflation might have something to do with increased prices, he's also developed serious celebrity status that allows him to charge exorbitant rates. Fekkai has also become extremely wealthy with his own line of shampoo, which goes for $22 a bottle. Celebrities like <a title="Meryl Streep Net Worth" href=#>Meryl Streep</a>, <a title="Uma Thurman Net Worth" href=#>Uma Thurman</a>, <a title="Charlize Theron Net Worth" href=#>Charlize Theron</a>, <a title="Sigourney Weaver Net Worth" href=#>Sigourney Weaver</a>, <a title="Salma Hayek Net Worth" href=#>Salma Hayek</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Scarlett Johansson Net Worth" href=#>Scarlett Johansson</a> - among others - have called upon Fekkai for his hair styling prowess.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=5-orlando-pita-800><b>5.

Ted Gibson $1,200</b></h2><p>Due to high demand and the popularity of his hairstyling services, Ted Gibson had to raise the price of a haircut from $950 to a whopping $1,200. As a star of the TLC show What Not to Wear, Gibson has become well known among television viewers the world over, and his celebrity clients reportedly include <a title="Renee Zellweger Net Worth" href=#>Renee Zellweger</a> and<a title="Anne Hathaway Net Worth" href=#> Anne Hathaway</a>.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-rossano-ferretti-1-600><b>3.

He has worked as a hairstylist for models in high end fashion shows from names such as Armani, Dior and Yves Saint Laurent. He has earned his reputation as one of the best and his name is branded on numerous high-end hair salons around the globe. Ferretti's special technique is about flattering a person’s face by the natural fall of a cut, rather than cutting the hair and shaping it into place afterwards.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-stuart-phillips-16-000><b>2.

However, none of them have shelled out quite as much cash for a haircut as Italian property developer Beverley Lateo. Phillips typically charges a mere $300 for a standard cut, but Lateo splurged and paid $16,000. Of course, the day-long salon experience from Phillips included not only the cut, but a champagne lunch, head massage and personalized hair products. Lateo’s flight and limo service were also included in the total price.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-ken-modestou-23-000><b>1.</b><b>Ken Modestou $23,000</b></h2><p>The sultan of Brunei has no problem spending ridiculous sums on a haircut. He pays for his favorite stylist, Ken Modestou, to fly to the other side of the globe just for a haircut. Modestou works at the Dorchester hotel in London and a haircut from him itself is not all that expensive, but the Sultan values the stylist so highly that he covers all the hairstylist's expenses for his time in Southeast Asia. The sum adds up to an absurd $23,000. The Sultan apparently flies out his favorite hairstylist on Singapore airlines, first class of course, every few weeks for a trim.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e5BpZKano6l6psTPnqWsoaaaeqmtyKuarqyjYravedOhnGavn6e5pXs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-most-expensive-haircuts-in-the-world.html&text=10%20Most%20Expensive%20Haircuts%20In%20The%20World&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-most-expensive-haircuts-in-the-world.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-most-expensive-haircuts-in-the-world.html&title=10%20Most%20Expensive%20Haircuts%20In%20The%20World" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-most-expensive-haircuts-in-the-world.html&title=10%20Most%20Expensive%20Haircuts%20In%20The%20World" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-most-expensive-haircuts-in-the-world.html&title=10%20Most%20Expensive%20Haircuts%20In%20The%20World" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-most-expensive-haircuts-in-the-world.html&description=10%20Most%20Expensive%20Haircuts%20In%20The%20World" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./reasons-we-want-julia-roberts-bff.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Reasons We Want Julia Roberts To Be Our BFF">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10-incredible-facts-about-the-lockheed-sr-71-blackbird.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Incredible Facts About the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
