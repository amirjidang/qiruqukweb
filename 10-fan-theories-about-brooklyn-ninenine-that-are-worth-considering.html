With popular shows, fans usually like to dig deep into the meaning behind certain episodes or characters, and this one has been no exception. As of 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooklyn Nine-Nine has come to an official close</a>, but some theories about the show are worth considering.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From crossovers to secret personalities or jobs, here some of the most interesting (and even downright ridiculous) <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fan theories</a> about <a href=#>Brooklyn Nine-Nine floating around on the internet</a>!</p><h2 id=could-there-be-a-hidden-39-the-good-place-39-crossover><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Could There Be A Hidden 'The Good Place' Crossover?</span></h2><p>What if Kevin is actually Shawn from The Good Place?! Maybe he wanted to meet Holt down on Earth so he can fall in love with her?!</p><p>Plenty of fans would definitely binge-watch a crossover show featuring The Good Place and Brooklyn Nine-Nine, so hopefully, this one is true!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Brooklyn Nine-Nine': What Are Hitchcock And Scully Like In Real Life?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-gina-depressed-and-hides-it-with-her-personality><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Is Gina Depressed And Hides It With Her Personality?</span></h2><p>On a sadder note, Gina could actually be seriously depressed. Maybe she acts in such a toxic way to other characters because she’s actually super sad.</p><p>It’s terrible, but this is definitely a common symptom of depression. Sometimes people try to make up for what they’re feeling inside by being nasty toward others, and fans know Gina can sure be annoying!</p><h2 id=could-there-be-a-secret-39-parks-and-rec-39-crossover><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Could There Be A Secret 'Parks And Rec' Crossover?</span></h2><p>Since the beginning of the show, Jake has been obsessed with working undercover. After joining the NYPD, Jake even spied on his own captain, overhearing rumours of New York joining forces with Indiana.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jake could have gone undercover as Parks and Rec’s Carl, the Park Ranger!</p><h2 id=did-holt-adopt-jake><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Did Holt Adopt Jake?</span></h2><p>Everyone knows the two characters have a relationship that mirrors what one would see between a father and son. This theory might be one of the most plausible theories on the list! Jake even sometimes called Holt 'dad'!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans React To 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine' Star Joe Truglio's Surprising New Project</a></span></p><h2 id=could-there-be-a-secret-39-new-girl-39-crossover><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Could There Be A Secret 'New Girl' Crossover?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In season 4, episode 4 of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Jake takes a car belonging to none other than Jess from New Girl! And then, in season 6, episode 4 of New Girl, <a href=#>we see some of the cast of Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a>!</p><p>Coincidence? Maybe not! Both of these shows are hilarious, and just imagine what kind of awesome TV show a brand-new crossover between the two comedies would make!</p><h2 id=could-there-be-more-secret-family-ties><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Could There Be More Secret Family Ties?</span></h2><p>What if Jake and Charles are actually half brothers? It would explain why Charles is so attached to Jake! Could be possible, but perhaps one show can only have so many secret familial ties.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-rosa-secretly-in-love-with-jake><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Is Rosa Secretly In love With Jake?</span></h2><p>Back when Jake showed discomfort with Dave Majors showing romantic interest in Amy, Rosa looks disappointed and asks Jake if he still likes her. And, when Rosa tries to come out as bisexual to her parents, she ends up telling them that she's actually in a relationship with Jake. Kind of like how Amy pretended to be engaged to Jake!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Is ‘Brooklyn-Nine-Nine’ Actress Stephanie Beatriz Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=was-there-more-to-karen-haas-rsquo-kidnapping><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Was There More To Karen Haas’ Kidnapping?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What if the Marshall, Karen Haas, was actually seduced by Figgis’ men when they were down in Florida? It would explain how she was so easily kidnapped. One would think Haas would have her wits about her, but what if her kidnapping was something more? What if she wasn’t kidnapped at all, but willingly went?</p><h2 id=is-holt-quietly-mentoring-boyle-on-the-side><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Is Holt Quietly Mentoring Boyle On The Side?</span></h2><p>Like Holt’s mentorship of Peralta back in the very first season, what if Holt has been mentoring other detectives as well? What if he has been mentoring Boyle, secretly?</p><p>For example, in the second season, episode 9 of the show, Holt doesn’t know how to cook, and asks Boyle to help him for his anniversary dinner. But in the first season, episode 9, the two characters had gone to examine a pizza shop that had burned to the ground. It’s revealed that Holt definitely reads Boyle’s food reviews, so obviously he’s no stranger to cooking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Why would he lie about not knowing how to cook? It seems like Holt might be trying to be purposely inadequate when it comes to cooking, just so he can stay close to Boyle and mentor him!</p><h2 id=could-there-be-a-secret-39-spongebob-squarepants-39-crossover><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Could There Be A Secret 'Spongebob Squarepants' Crossover?</span></h2><p>Okay, this one’s just for fun. It’s a bit ridiculous, but what if Scully and Hitchcock later became Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?! If it isn’t true, which it probably isn’t, wouldn’t that’d be a spin-off show for the ages? Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are a hilarious dynamic duo, not unlike Scully and Hitchcock.</p><p>This one might actually be the only true theory on this list, for all fans know. The Internet’s musings know no bounds!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In conclusion, the famous comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine has had a fantastic run of eight full seasons of fun, drama, and laughs. Fans surely will miss the show, but here’s hoping TV creators listen to some of these theories and make a spin-off, or even a hybrid show with another comedy like Parks and Rec, The Good Place, New Girl, or even Spongebob Squarepants!</p><p>Fans can dream, right?</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine' Star Joe Lo Truglio Amassed His $2 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWWlrtuwMeepquhlah6oq7OrqtmmqKkvKy42Kdkp6GemruqusRmq6GZpGKus7GMsKarrJhisLC60qKbnqqZo7Rw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-fan-theories-about-brooklyn-ninenine-that-are-worth-considering.html&text=10%20Fan%20Theories%20About%20%27Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine%27%20That%20Are%20Worth%20Considering&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-fan-theories-about-brooklyn-ninenine-that-are-worth-considering.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-fan-theories-about-brooklyn-ninenine-that-are-worth-considering.html&title=10%20Fan%20Theories%20About%20%27Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine%27%20That%20Are%20Worth%20Considering" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-fan-theories-about-brooklyn-ninenine-that-are-worth-considering.html&title=10%20Fan%20Theories%20About%20%27Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine%27%20That%20Are%20Worth%20Considering" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-fan-theories-about-brooklyn-ninenine-that-are-worth-considering.html&title=10%20Fan%20Theories%20About%20%27Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine%27%20That%20Are%20Worth%20Considering" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-fan-theories-about-brooklyn-ninenine-that-are-worth-considering.html&description=10%20Fan%20Theories%20About%20%27Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine%27%20That%20Are%20Worth%20Considering" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kate-hudson-expensive-things-bought.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Ridiculously Expensive Things That Kate Hudson Bought">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10-celebs-and-their-embarrassing-japanese-ads.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Celebs And Their Embarrassing Japanese Commercials">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
