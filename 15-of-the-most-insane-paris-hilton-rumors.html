Some look at her as a spoiled rich brat who had everything handed to her. They see her as a wanna-be Barbie, the spawn of privilege and the worst of its kind at that. And to these people I say: you are absolutely correct. As a person, Paris Hilton has done little with her influence and money except to further her own ambitions. Her relentless self-promotion has bordered on ridiculous. She is the quintessential picture of excess. She has been able to do and say whatever she has wanted and has seemingly got away with quite a bit over the years. She is a "party girl," a self-professed night owl who hasn't met a drink or a drug she hasn't liked. Paris Hilton has made herself a big target and she loves every minute of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paris Hilton can be attacked relentlessly for many things (and for good reason), but what she has given to many other talentless attractive women out there is a template&nbsp;for success. Whereas in the past, many beautiful women who lacked any talent had to marry-up in order to achieve success, Paris laid out a whole new avenue for them. She was the first true reality television star. She was the first Internet sensation. Paris Hilton has laid the groundwork for such untalented, but attractive women, as the <a href=#>Kardashian Klan</a> and hundreds of other sexy women who have posed half-naked and sensationalized themselves. Paris also has racked up quite the career of rumors. She is slender and beautiful and has made a life out of being famously wealthy. Now we tackle the 15 craziest Paris Hilton rumors.</p><h2 id=15-naming-rights><strong>15. Naming Rights</strong></h2><p>Many assumed that Paris Hilton was named after the famed French city. And why not? It makes perfect sense. Her family is uber-wealthy and she has traveled the world. Paris herself has modeled from New York to the famed runways all across Europe. So of course, Paris Hilton would be named after the city of Paris. But the fact of the matter is, Paris Hilton is actually named after Paris, Texas. And just like Paris, France, Paris, Texas erected an Eiffel Tower of their own in 1993. When Paris, Tennessee built their own version of the tower, Paris, Texas added a red cowboy hat atop theirs. Located in the very northeastern portion of Texas and having just over 20,000 residents, this town seems like an odd place for socialite extraordinaire Paris to be named after. Perhaps she was named after the movie with the same name, Paris, Texas. We're not 100% certain on that one so it's a TBD.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-denied-by-hugh-hefner><strong>14. Denied By Hugh Hefner</strong></h2><p>There is a lot to&nbsp;like about Paris Hilton once you strip away the silliness and one-liners. Yes, it is quite annoying when she says, "so hot." Many of us may even want her to fall flat on her face. But the reality is, Paris Hilton is hot. She is a beautiful woman who knows how to use her sleek stature to her advantage. However, when Paris started to sniff around Playboy with the hopes of getting inside the coveted pages, she was denied. Unfortunately, Paris didn't make the cut and the reason may cause your head to tilt to the side just a bit. Rumor has it that it wasn't her lack of a large bosom that kept Paris out of the magazine, but rather, her "strange looking" privates. That's right- apparently Paris's undercarriage isn't exactly as photogenic as the rest of her. Either way, we still find her quite sexy.</p><h2 id=13-name-change><strong>13. Name Change</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Paris Jackson</a> is a beautiful young woman, one of the heirs to the King of Pop's massive throne. <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a> died prematurely, a terrible end to a man who lived an amazing, and controversial, life. Aside from Michael's success, he loved to be around children. So it was only a matter of time before he had a couple of his own. Paris is his beloved daughter and rumor has it that Paris Hilton wasn't too thrilled that another famous Paris would emerge to steal some of her name thunder.&nbsp;The story goes that Michael Jackson and mama Hilton went&nbsp;to school together and were friends. Paris Hilton claims that Michael always&nbsp;liked the name and asked&nbsp;the Hilton matriarch if he could use the name for his daughter. According to Paris Hilton, Paris Jackson is named after&nbsp;her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-std-alert><strong>12. STD Alert</strong></h2><p>Of course partygirls are known for a few different things. One thing is knowing how to have a good time. Another is drinking and being the life of the party. And finally, anyone who enjoys too much sometimes has the occasion to be a bit promiscuous. For a normal person, this is a terrible inconvenience. For a celebrity, this is terrible news. For Paris Hilton, the image of American party royalty, news of an STD can be terribly detrimental. Paris Hilton allowed a storage container of hers to lapse, as the rent was not paid. This is a big mistake for a celebrity- especially when the items inside got auctioned off. One of the items auctioned was the prescription drug Valtrex. The drug is used to fight genital herpes. We aren't sure what is more disturbing, Paris Hilton having herpes or the fact that some loon wanted to buy her vagina medication.</p><h2 id=11-nickname><strong>11. Nickname</strong></h2><p>Paris Hilton is a tall, lanky beauty. She has a natural model build, one that has scored her many runway appearances. Certainly, Paris's namesake brings a lot of attention to her, but she is a slender 5' 8" tall. One nickname Paris's mother and grandmother gave her was "Star." The public has also named her "The Heiress." One rumor has Paris's nickname as "Flamingo" due to her height and slender build. Watching Paris walk you can see the nickname and how it would stick as a kid. But "Star" is the more adequate one. The girl who coined the phrase, "I don't really think, I just walk," struts her stuff like a confident and self-assured flamingo so the name certainly works for us.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-girl-on-girl><strong>10. Girl On Girl</strong></h2><p>What is the line between gay and straight? What constitutes someone who is bisexual? Although Paris Hilton has never publicly defined herself, we have seen many instances in which Paris Hilton has made out with other women. Whether it was at an awards show or inside clubs, Paris Hilton has kissed and made out with tens of women. Paris even hooked up at the "L Word" party. She also reportedly hooked up with actress <a href=#>Elisha Cuthbert</a>. There were once awesome rumors abounding that <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> may just have hooked up with Hilton! According to her ex, <a href=#>Kevin Federline</a>, Spears is bisexual and had an urge to meet up with Hilton. As much as Hilton is all about the ladies, guy-on-guy isn't nearly as impressive to her. She was heard talking negatively about gay men and had to issue an apology through GLAD about it. We will stick with casually bisexual as her designation.</p><h2 id=9-substances><strong>9.&nbsp;Substances</strong></h2><p>Unfortunately for Paris Hilton, drugs are a part of her life. Anyone that thinks otherwise is blind. Many socialites have the means and the money to do whatever they want, whenever they want. Paris has shown a propensity throughout her life for making waves and not carrying a bit what the world thinks about her. She is one of the most unapologetic reality stars ever. The first young woman for being famous for being famous has left a trail of partying that is most evident inside the walls of many exclusive clubs. Her use of cocaine and pot is well known throughout her inner circles. She was even busted for cocaine possession back in 2010 while in Las Vegas. Hilton had a baggie that contained .8g of cocaine. In addition, during the FIFA World Cup in 2010, Hilton was tossed from a game at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium for smoking weed. Listen, she does drugs. Period.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-king-fling><strong>8. King Fling</strong></h2><p>Michael Jackson is known as the King of Pop. The deceased&nbsp;legend did more than just transcend style and pop music, he created the gold standard for stadium concerts and showmanship. Michael Jackson set the bar extremely high in a business where too many artists look to take shortcuts. He was relentless in his music. But his personal life was another story. Jackson was accused of having a "tendency" toward youths. What happened and what didn't happened is a whole other story. But Jackson had a personal relationship with Paris's mother and it is rumored that he and Paris may have hooked up. This, however, is inaccurate. Any photos taken of Jackson and Hilton in which media and others made accusations would be false. Paris actually used to refer to Michael Jackson as her "uncle." We see no smoke or fire here for this rumor.</p><h2 id=7-restoration-girl><strong>7. Restoration Girl</strong></h2><p>Having hobbies is good for everyone. People always benefit from a distraction away from reality. We all enjoy different kinds of hobbies that range from sports to music to stamp collecting to whatever. No hobby is better than another for someone who is passionate. But it certainly seems awfully strange that the heiress herself enjoys rebuilding vintage radios, but it is more than just a rumor. Back in 2015, numerous reports surfaced that Paris Hilton enjoyed rebuilding old radios. Paris Hilton supposedly has a room full of former WW2 aircraft radios. In addition, supposedly in 2006, Paris Hilton was spotted attempting to apply for a HAM license. There was media outreach to Paris Hilton's rep, who stated that she does not restore radios. The jury is out on this one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-party-girl><strong>6. Party Girl</strong></h2><p>Paris Hilton has lived in a suite at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, Beverly Hills and the Hamptons. Paris grew up partying with the likes of her best friends <a href=#>Nicole Richie</a> and <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>. These children of privilege shared one common bond: they had no boundaries. They were able to enjoy the nightlife with little concern for the daily stresses that many other young people in their late teens and early 20s deal with. Paris became a regular at clubs in the most popular cities around the world. In the United States, she was a regular on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, California and she enjoyed the nightlife in the clubs in Las Vegas, Nevada. She frequented dance clubs in New York and Miami. Paris was a party machine, rubbing elbows with celebrities and the most famous and rich the world has had to offer. She did so with a smile, posing for photographers on her way in and out, whether she was sober or wasted. Paris loves the nightlife and likes the attention even more. She is most definitely a big-time party girl.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-dj-who><strong>5. DJ Who?</strong></h2><p>What do you do when you are rich and have nothing to do? Well, if you're Paris Hilton and&nbsp;you&nbsp;love to hang&nbsp;out in clubs, why not try your luck at DJing? The underground club scene is ripe with&nbsp;rumors over Paris Hilton becoming a star DJ. Of course, this makes perfect sense.&nbsp;If you look closer at Paris Hilton's supposed love for electronics and you combine that with&nbsp;a career that has been spent partying in clubs (who wouldn't want that job!), that equals out nicely to Paris stepping into the realm of DJing. However, before we start to applaud Paris for being such a legendary DJ, a photo which was leaked shows a technician reaching&nbsp;in front of Paris when she seems to have a problem with her equipment. The question then becomes is Paris really DJing or&nbsp;is she putting on a show? Paris wants legitimacy but the rumors of her being a&nbsp;qualified DJ are vastly overstated. She is a "work in progress" on this one.</p><h2 id=4-film-star><strong>4. "Film Star"</strong></h2><p>Back in 2003, long before Kim Kardashian's 2007 "leaked" sex tape, Paris had her own tape surface. The 2003 tape featured Paris doing the dirty with her boyfriend <a href=#>Rick Salomon</a>. The tape was released with the name One Night&nbsp;in Paris (we love the wordplay) and was a big time sensation. Just as the Internet was finding its way, Paris Hilton dominated both the&nbsp;emerging Internet world as well as the magazine world.&nbsp;She was the "it" girl. The release of the sex tape coincidentally occurred just prior to the launch of Hilton's reality series with bestie Nicole Richie called The Simple Life. &nbsp;The sex tape was a media sensation and Paris was paid off for the tape leak. However, it is once again questionable that the tape would be released so closely to her reality show. There is a lot to this where another wanna-be reality star sold themselves in a sex tape coinciding with other business matters (ahem-Kim Kardashian). The fact that these two are friends and both used their sex tapes to their advantage is no coincidence; it's all part of the playbook.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-doggie-stylin><strong>3. Doggie Stylin'</strong></h2><p>When you think of doggy-style and Paris Hilton, the last thing that probably comes to mind are the pictures above. It is rumored that Paris Hilton spends more on her dogs than&nbsp;an average human being spends on their own home. It is more than a rumor that Paris Hilton spent over $325,000 to build her dogs a 200 square foot custom-made doggy house. The&nbsp;dog house&nbsp;was constructed to mimic the style of her own home. Paris Hilton's&nbsp;ultimate goal was most likely to get&nbsp;into Life and Style Magazine, which she accomplished. The average price of a home purchased in the United States is $188,900. Hilton's doggy mansion is nearly twice that. In addition to the doggy mansion, Hilton is also known to go out and buy extraordinary gifts for her pets to the tune of $8,000 a pop.</p><h2 id=2-calling-aa><strong>2. Calling AA</strong></h2><p>Paris Hilton is an alcoholic- maybe. There have been many photos that have highlighted Paris Hilton and her partying ways. In addition to her drug use, Paris has had well-chronicled issues with alcohol abuse. Hilton's former boyfriend, the singer <a href=#>Nick Carter</a>, remembered a time when her sensational appetite for drugs and alcohol fed into his worst demons and led him down that dark path. The Backstreet Boy recounts that&nbsp;they would polish off a bottle or two of vodka a night. They also partook in ecstasy, amongst other drugs.&nbsp;Back in 2006 Hilton was arrested and charged with drinking and driving. In 2007, the Huffington Post published an article entitled "My Name is Paris and I am an Alcoholic."&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris drinks and drinks. She parties and parties. She has been hospitalized numerous times with no indication as to why. The denial over Hilton's issues within her inner circle will leave us with guesswork over whether she is actually an alcoholic, but without certainly, she is both a drug and alcohol abuser.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-she-is-brilliant><strong>1. She Is Brilliant</strong></h2><p>Look, anyone that doesn't see the brilliance in Paris Hilton isn't looking close enough. There are many people in the world who have money. There are many people in the world who are attractive. But there are few who have thrust themselves completely into the abyss of societal hell called the paparazzi and emerged positively victorious. Remember prior to the Internet explosion when entertainment rags were the big deal&nbsp;at the supermarket. That is where we got our gossip. And so many front pages had Paris Hilton posing outside of clubs, like a princess gliding through the party world with ice in her veins. She smiled victoriously, allowing photog after photog to snap away. She hid from nothing and embraced everything. Paris Hilton built a brand. She used the media and spun them like a dreidel. She had no talent to be a TV star, and yet she got her own show. She had no reason to be in the fragrance business, and yet, her perfume is everywhere. She wants to DJ? Why not?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paris has taken her brand to levels that few have seen and did it through media tools, setting the standard for others to follow in her path. She is a trailblazer, the unapologetic spoiled brat who has taken the world for a ride with brilliant tactical use of her smile, body, and silly catches phrases. As much as many may laugh and mock her, her brand is as big as any. Friends have said her blonde act is just that, an act. BUT...and this is a big "but," Paris is who she is.
