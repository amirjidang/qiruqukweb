In this article, we'll take a look at <strong>what Larry David's net worth is</strong>, some possible reasons why the comedian decided to keep it a secret, and the 2015 interview when he refused to say his net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-larry-david-39-s-net-worth-and-why-won-39-t-he-talk-about-it>What Is Larry David's Net Worth And Why Won't He Talk About It?</h2><p>For several years now, Larry David's <strong>net worth has been reported as</strong><strong>$400 million</strong>. At the time of this writing, this is the most recent figure according to Celebrity Net Worth and several other sources. However, David won't confirm or deny this number, and he won't share the truth about how much money he has.</p><p>If Curb Your Enthusiasm and Seinfeld fans know one thing about the writer, comedian, and actor, it's that he doesn't want to talk about his net worth. The reason for this? He <strong>doesn't think that it's anyone else's business</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_how-much-of-larry-david-s-net-worth-comes-from-curb-your-enthusiasm-_bk_a1.jpg><p>According to The New York Post, Larry David appeared on Who's Talking To Chris Wallace and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">got upset when Wallace talked to him about money</a>.

But when Chris Wallace mentioned that <strong>some sources say Larry David has a $500 million net worth</strong>, David pretended to spit out the water he was drinking. That was definitely a bit of an intense reaction to the question, but David can be a bit of an intense person, as his fans know.</p><p>He said:</p><p>"By the way, I'm out of water. Okay. I'm out. I'm gonna say what should have been said to your father, okay: None of your f*cking business. How about that? And that's ridiculous. ... That number is so preposterous, okay?

While he might not have quite that much, he does seem to earn a good living every year, at least according to several sources. According to Parade and Celebrity Net Worth, David <strong>earns $40 million-$50 million annually </strong>because of video sales, merchandise, royalties, and syndication for Seinfeld. It seems that if David really did have a $500 million net worth, he might want to just make a public statement and get it over with. Then again, he might still want to keep this information private.</p><p>Who Are Some Of The Wealthiest Sitcom Stars?
