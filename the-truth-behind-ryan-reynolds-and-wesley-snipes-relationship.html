As a result, the competition in the acting world is so fierce that when a tiny role in a forgettable TV show is up for grabs, a slew of actors are willing to waste their whole day waiting to audition.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since there are so many actors vying for every role, it makes sense that <a href=# rel=nofollow>some actors go to extremes to pull off their characters</a>. However, actors should not have to put up with a bunch of crap from other performers who act like jerks on set.</p><p>As anyone who has seen a Ryan Reynolds interview will likely attest, he always comes across as the type of person who would get along with most people. It turns out, however, that there is an iconic actor that Reynolds dislikes so much that he is unwilling to work with him in the future... And that would be his Blade: Trinity co-star, Wesley Snipes. Let's take a look at what brought these two together and eventually pulled them apart.</p><p><strong>Updated on February 23, 2023:</strong> During an interview with IGN, Ryan Reynolds revealed that due to Wesley Snipes' approach to total immersive method acting, Reynolds "<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">never met Wesley</a>, I only met Blade." While it was no doubt an unpleasant time on set, the actor shared that he has the "utmost respect" for Snipes and the way he attacks his roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Ryan Reynolds And Blake Lively Both Caught Feelings For One Another On A Double Date, With Different Dates</a></span></p><h2 id=ryan-reynolds-has-had-many-comic-book-roles>Ryan Reynolds Has Had Many Comic Book Roles</h2><p>These days, Ryan Reynolds is perhaps best known for playing the hilarious comic book antihero Deadpool on the big screen. However, a lot of Reynolds’ younger fans may not know that before Ryan began playing the merc with a mouth, he had already taken on roles in other comic book movies.</p><p>Over the last several years, Ryan Reynolds has been more than happy to make fun of himself for starring in one of the most roundly reviled comic book movies of the modern era, Green Lantern. After all, both of Reynolds’ Deadpool films have mocked his Green Lantern film, and he is prone to poking fun at the movie during his interviews. Of course, given the fact that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Reynolds met his wife Blake Lively</a> because of Green Lantern, he clearly has some fond memories of making the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ryan-Reynolds-and-Blake-Lively-for-Green-Lantern.jpg><p>Unlike Green Lantern, Ryan Reynolds seems to have had a completely miserable experience making the first comic book movie he ever starred in, Blade: Trinity. In fact, making the movie seems to have been such a bad experience for the highly verbose actor that he notably seems to be reluctant to ever talk about working on it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>How Deadpool Changed T.J. Miller's Life And Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=wesley-snipes-was-a-terror-to-work-with>Wesley Snipes Was A Terror To Work With</h2><p>Prior to the release of Blade: Trinity in 2004, there was a lot of conjecture in the press that the film was meant to spawn a new movie franchise that would star Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel. In the years since, however, all the discussion about Blade: Trinity relates to reports of <a href=# rel=nofollow>Wesley Snipes’ childish behavior</a> on set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for Blade: Trinity director David S. Goyer, Snipes seemed to detest him for some reason. As a result, Snipes refused to talk to Goyer according to his co-star Patton Oswalt. Instead, Snipes would only communicate with Goyer through post-it notes that the actor always signed “From Blade”.</p><p>If that wasn’t bad enough, Snipes reportedly refused to even open his eyes while he filmed one scene. As a result, the Blade: Trinity production team had to use CGI to digitally open Snipes’ eyes onscreen. Sadly, the effect is laughably bad in the final film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Untitled-design-2020-03-17T070602.614.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Wesley Snipes reportedly unloaded most of his ire on director David S, Goyer during the filming process, the actor’s co-stars were not immune to his behavior. For example, Snipes reportedly referred to Ryan Reynolds as “that cracker.”</p><p>On top of that, Patton Oswalt made it seem like Snipes avoided working with Reynolds whenever he could. "A lot of the lines that Ryan Reynolds has were just a result of Wesley not being there. We would all just think of things for him to say and then cut to Wesley's face not doing anything because that's all we could get from him."</p><p>For his part, Ryan Reynolds has not directly addressed reports of his highly contentious relationship with Wesley Snipes. That said, in 2016, a Première Magazine reporter brought up the fact that Snipes had been tossing around the idea of a fourth Blade movie during a Reynolds interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Blade Director David S. Goyer Hired Bikers As Bodyguards For On-Set Protection Against Wesley Snipes</a></span></p><p>When the reporter went to ask Reynolds if he would join the project, Ryan began to shake his head the second it became clear that was where the question was going. While Reynolds claimed he would not work on a proposed Blade 4 because he does not want to be a part of any non-Deadpool comic book movies, his initial reaction spoke volumes.</p><h2 id=what-is-wesley-rsquo-s-take-on-things>What Is Wesley’s Take On Things?</h2><p>Throughout Wesley Snipes’ time in the spotlight, he has had a hard time in a lot of different ways. For example, according to a book, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Mike Tyson once knocked Snipes out</a> and the actor had to spend some time in prison due to tax evasion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/wesley-snipes-movie.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given everything that Snipes has gone through, it makes sense that he has not spent too much time refuting the reports of his rotten behavior on the set of Blade: Trinity. However, during a 2012 AV Club interview, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Snipes denied some of the more outrageous claims</a> about his demeanor on set.</p><p>For example, Snipes completely denied claims that he choked out David S. Goyer on set. Snipes also denied claims that he only communicated with Goyer through post-it notes. That said, Snipes did not say anything about Ryan Reynolds, and the fact remains that it seems clear that the two actors will never work together again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmZ6gmaOxbr7YmqVmqpWuu7C4w6xkmqaUYsSmv8uesGarnp69pr%2BMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-truth-behind-ryan-reynolds-and-wesley-snipes-relationship.html&text=The%20Truth%20Behind%20Ryan%20Reynolds%20And%20Wesley%20Snipes%27%20Relationship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-truth-behind-ryan-reynolds-and-wesley-snipes-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-behind-ryan-reynolds-and-wesley-snipes-relationship.html&title=The%20Truth%20Behind%20Ryan%20Reynolds%20And%20Wesley%20Snipes%27%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-truth-behind-ryan-reynolds-and-wesley-snipes-relationship.html&title=The%20Truth%20Behind%20Ryan%20Reynolds%20And%20Wesley%20Snipes%27%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-behind-ryan-reynolds-and-wesley-snipes-relationship.html&title=The%20Truth%20Behind%20Ryan%20Reynolds%20And%20Wesley%20Snipes%27%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-truth-behind-ryan-reynolds-and-wesley-snipes-relationship.html&description=The%20Truth%20Behind%20Ryan%20Reynolds%20And%20Wesley%20Snipes%27%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tracy-chapman-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tracy Chapman Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-truth-about-seal-team-star-max-thieriots-net-worth-income.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Truth About 'SEAL Team' Star Max Thieriot's Net Worth ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
