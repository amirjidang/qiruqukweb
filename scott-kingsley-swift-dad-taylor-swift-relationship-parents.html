At the young age of 11, Taylor made it clear she had her eye set on one of the biggest prizes, a record deal!</p><p>After putting everything she had into songwriting and learning the guitar, Swift's parents sold their Pennsylvania home <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to move on down to Nashville, Tennessee</a> so Taylor could properly pursue music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/despite-the-success-of-the-eras-tour-taylor-swift-wasn-t-immune-to-forgetting-the-lyrics-of-her-songs.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Despite The Success Of The Eras Tour, Taylor Swift Felt Awful On-Stage After She Messed Up An Artist's Name">Despite The Success Of The Eras Tour, Taylor Swift Felt Awful On-Stage After She Messed Up An Artist's Name</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift felt awful about a particular blunder during the Eras Tour, and apologized for it.</p><p>The star has made it very clear that her parents have always been her number one supporters.
