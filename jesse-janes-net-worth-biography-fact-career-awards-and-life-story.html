In June 2019, she briefly came out of retirement to shoot her first interracial scene after which she retired again. Over the course of her career, Jesse was nominated for and won several adult entertainment industry awards such as AVN, FAME, XBIZ, NightMoves, and XRCO awards.</p><p><strong>Mainstream Appearances and Other Ventures: </strong>In addition to her adult film career, Jesse has appeared in several mainstream films and TV shows. In 2004, she made a cameo appearance in the film “Starsky & Hutch.” She also appeared on the cover of Drowning Pool’s album, “Desensitized.” In 2005, Jesse was featured as UnRated Magazine’s Vixen as part of a launch of the music review magazine’s new edition of Vixens. Jane was a guest star in the HBO dramedy “Entourage,” in the ninth episode of season two in an episode titled “I Love You Too.” On February 28, 2007 she featured on the Danish late-night show “den 11.”</p><p>In 2009, she appeared in the reality series “The Bad Girls Club” and that same year, Jane was the focus of a CNBC documentary titled “Porn: Business of Pleasure.” In November 2010, Jane was named the Australian Penthouse “Pet of the Month.” In January 2011, Jane was named by journalist Chris Morris as one of the 12 most popular stars in adult which he published on CNBC. She was named again on his list in 2014 of “The Dirty Dozen: Porn’s Most Popular Stars.”</p><p>Jesse Jane is also an entrepreneur having launched a brand of tequila called Diosa.</p><p><strong>Personal Life:</strong> Jane had breast enhancement surgery in February 2007.</p><p>In 2007, she married fellow adult star Rick Patrick.
