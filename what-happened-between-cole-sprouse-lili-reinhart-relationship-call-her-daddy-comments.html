Fans were ecstatic, and it didn't take long for Cole and Lili to become one of the most adored couples in the young Hollywood scene.</p><p>However, their <a href=#>love story came to an unexpected end</a> in March 2020, when they announced their split. Fans were left shocked by the news, but it wasn't until recently that the internet began to turn on Cole Sprouse.</p><p>In several podcast interviews, Sprouse has made comments that many are calling disrespectful and humiliating towards his ex-girlfriend. Fans are now speaking out, accusing Sprouse of being insensitive and cruel towards Reinhart.</p><p>Here's why the internet is not pleased with Cole Spouses' treatment of Lili Reinhart, and how this once beloved couple may never be seen in the same light again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cole-sprouse-39-s-call-her-daddy-smoking-scandal>Cole Sprouse's Call Her Daddy Smoking Scandal</h2><p>Cole Sprouse is no stranger to podcast appearances, but his recent interview on the Call Her Daddy podcast has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">garnered an unexpected amount of attention</a> for an unusual reason: his cigarette.</p><p>During the interview, Sprouse was seen smoking indoors and taking a particularly long drag on his cigarette.
