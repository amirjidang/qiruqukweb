While many celebrities are known to keep themselves from harm’s way and perform little work, others go above and beyond to show their commitment to the role and bring their <a href=#>most authentic self forward for audiences to see</a>. At the same time, to stay true to their role, some change their weight, appearance, and even personality for the duration of the filming.</p><p>In action films, the most challenging part for any celebrity is the action sequences often performed by stunt doubles. Many actors are known to risk it all while filming for the movies, giving their 100% to the characters and refusing to let somebody else do their dirty work. Most films today have intense car scenes that grip audiences' attention, and stars love to be a part of these sequences. Let’s look at the celebrities who love to drive their cars in movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-cruise><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Tom Cruise</span></h2><p>A man of many talents, Tom Cruise, is famously known for doing all his work in movies, from stunts to action sequences.
