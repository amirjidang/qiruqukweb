Viewers tune in to see disgusting, filthy, slimy, and overall gross working conditions and they just can't seem to get enough. There seems to be something captivating about filthy work conditions and Mike Rowe hosts the show perfectly, making it seem like 'just another day' in his disgusting shoes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We never know what sort of sloppy situation Mike will get himself into, but we're always ready to tune in and follow along while he embarks on some filthy adventures. Similar to other reality-based television shows, there's a lot that happens behind the scenes of Dirty Jobs that you may be surprised to learn about.</p><h2 id=dirty-jobs-wasn-t-a-success-right-away-amp-was-rejected-several-times><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Dirty Jobs Wasn’t&nbsp;A Success Right Away &&nbsp;Was Rejected Several Times</span></h2><p>The success of this show right now is undeniable, yet you may be surprised to hear that this wasn't always the case. In fact, the show had difficulty gaining traction in its early days, and there were fears it wouldn't last. After several rejections and many failed efforts, the show finally took off and saw success in later years.</p><h2 id=the-show-has-restrictions-they-can-t-handle-crime-scenes><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>The Show Has Restrictions – They Can’t Handle Crime Scenes</span></h2><p>It seems as though there's no job too dirty for Mike Rowe,&nbsp;but the reality is that even this dirtiest of dirty fellows has to draw the line somewhere. The producers of this show refuse to tackle any job related to a crime scene in any way. They simply don't want to get that gross. Apparently that clean up mission is just too dirty for Dirty Jobs!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-show-s-theme-song-was-written-by-rowe-and-his-friends-while-they-were-drunk><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>The Show’s Theme Song Was Written By Rowe And His Friends… While They Were Drunk!</span></h2><p>We wish we had a more glamorous story to share with you, but the truth is the theme song for Dirty Jobs was written by a very drunk Mike Rowe. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranker, </a>after a night of boozing and enjoying some oysters with his buddies, Mike began to belt out what we now know as being the theme song of the show.</p><h2 id=the-producers-have-no-way-to-prepare-for-shooting-absolutely-nothing-is-scripted><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>The Producers Have No Way To Prepare For Shooting – Absolutely Nothing Is Scripted</span></h2><p>This fun fact just made us even more interested in tuning in to this show. Things aren't always as they seem! If you thought the producers came in and scoped the area&nbsp;& cultivated the set for this show, you're sadly mistaken. We were surprised to learn that most of this show is hinged on Rowe's ability to throw himself into unknown territory to see what may end up happening.</p><h2 id=the-show-s-narration-is-added-after-the-shoot-is-done><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>The Show’s Narration Is Added After The Shoot Is Done</span></h2><p>Here's something we did not know about this show! Entertainment Weekly reports that Mike Rowe is on-site getting dirty on the job while scenes are shot, but then he goes into the studio and adds the&nbsp;narration to the scenes. The script is prepared in advance, then the&nbsp;narration is layered in. This is a lot less "reality" based than we had hoped.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-filming-process-sometimes-lasts-20-straight-hours><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The Filming Process Sometimes Lasts 20 Straight Hours</span></h2><p>There's... just... so... much... dirt. Filming for the show is dirty and time consuming, and it can sometimes take well over 20 hours to shoot a single episode. The production crew tends to go hard when it's time to film, making sure all the details are aligned. Filming is painfully slow.</p><h2 id=the-show-has-caused-bodily-harm-to-rowe><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>The Show Has&nbsp;Caused Bodily Harm To Rowe</span></h2><p>It's no secret that Mike Rowe has been injured while on the job, shooting scenes for this show. We wish we could report one isolated incident, but injuries seem to happen here very quickly. During an episode in season one, Rowe stood too close to a blast furnace and both his eyebrows were singed. His contact lenses were essentially stuck in his eyes as a result.</p><h2 id=the-show-turned-down-a-rendering-plant-due-to-mob-fears><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Show Turned Down A Rendering Plant Due To Mob Fears</span></h2><p>Well, here's a good reason to say "no" to a contract! Mike Rowe was propositioned by a rendering plant, and by all accounts, that would seem to be a really cool segment.&nbsp; However, some risks are just not worth it. Such buildings have been known to be mob-owned, so the producers of the show "passed" on this opportunity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-show-exposes-the-crew-to-dangerous-conditions><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Show Exposes The&nbsp;Crew To Dangerous Conditions</span></h2><p>It goes without saying that this show exposes everyone to some pretty dangerous situations. The crew are often handling&nbsp;chemicals and poisons, finding themselves in very dangerous situations and so much more.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast Company </a>reported on an episode in which the crew were forced to work in a salt mine, surrounded by explosives!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>4 Reality TV Hosts Who Are Jerks (16 That Are Sweethearts)</a></span></p><h2 id=a-cameraman-was-attacked-by-a-monkey><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>A Cameraman Was Attacked By A Monkey</span></h2><p>That's not a story you'll hear every day, but trust us, it happened. When filming in a monkey sanctuary in South Africa, cameraman Chris Whiteneck was attacked by a monkey. That can't be pleasant, and it's hard to explain to someone that this is just one of the potential hazards of this job.</p><h2 id=rowe-was-bitten-by-a-shark-due-to-unsafe-conditions><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Rowe Was Bitten By A Shark Due To Unsafe Conditions</span></h2><p>This is just plain scary. Calling this an "unsafe work environment" is putting it way too lightly. Mike Rowe told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a> about his very scary encounter with a shark while filming Dirty Jobs. Aside from the obvious fear and trauma involved in this incident, he was also bitten by the shark and injured. Of course, Mike considers this to be one of the worst jobs he was involved in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Fakest Discovery Channel Shows (And 10 That Are Actually Real)</a></span></p><h2 id=the-show-has-never-won-an-emmy-but-has-been-nominated-numerous-times><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Show Has Never Won An Emmy, But Has Been Nominated Numerous Times</span></h2><p>Dirty Jobs&nbsp;captured a worldwide audience, ready to be in awe of the next bizarre situations Mike Rowe finds himself in. This unique twist on employment standards has everyone mesmerized, yet for some reason the show&nbsp;couldn't seem to snag an Emmy. After numerous nominations without an Emmy award, we're left to question how to measure the success of the show.</p><h2 id=the-show-couldn-t-conceal-rowe-s-inappropriate-comment-to-oscar-the-grouch><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Show Couldn’t Conceal Rowe’s Inappropriate Comment To Oscar The Grouch</span></h2><p>There's no amount of editing and cover up that can ever make this incident disappear.&nbsp; We're pretty sure Mike Rowe regrets his disastrously inappropriate appearance on Sesame Street. It started off in an adorable way, with Oscar and Rowe bonding over "dirty" jobs, but ended with Rowe saying he's "always wanted to go in through the back door." Clearly, this caused quite a stir and was highly inappropriate for the wholesome children's show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Best Shows You Can Find On Discovery Channel (And 5 To Avoid)</a></span></p><h2 id=the-show-conceals-the-fact-that-rowe-isn-t-handy-at-all><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Show Conceals The Fact That Rowe Isn't Handy At All</span></h2><p>Considering the nature of the jobs he finds himself in, we all assumed that Mike Rowe would be a pretty handy guy. He seems to fare well in any situation he finds himself in.&nbsp; Shockingly though, he admits to not being handy at all. He slides by on passion and the entertainment value he's able to bring to the table.</p><h2 id=the-show-was-canceled-and-rowe-jumped-ship-to-a-copycat-show><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Show Was Canceled And Rowe Jumped Ship To A Copycat Show</span></h2><p>Loyalty is clearly not the biggest deal to Mike Rowe. After 7 successful seasons on Dirty Jobs, Mike Rowe pitched a virtually identical copycat show to CNN.&nbsp;It was titled Somebody's Gotta Do It, and was essentially the exact same structure and format of Dirty Jobs. This was perhaps not the most ethical move of his career.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>20 Things Fan Keep Ignoring About Dirty Jobs</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiboqqkrnqru8GsZK2gmaO0tHnAq5ynrF2mwqrAxGauoZmkYsGpsdhmqp6dnWQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdirty-jobs-things-arent-quite-what-they-seem.html&text=15%20Things%20About%20Discovery%27s%20%27Dirty%20Jobs%27%20That%20Aren%27t%20Quite%20What%20They%20Seem&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdirty-jobs-things-arent-quite-what-they-seem.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdirty-jobs-things-arent-quite-what-they-seem.html&title=15%20Things%20About%20Discovery%27s%20%27Dirty%20Jobs%27%20That%20Aren%27t%20Quite%20What%20They%20Seem" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdirty-jobs-things-arent-quite-what-they-seem.html&title=15%20Things%20About%20Discovery%27s%20%27Dirty%20Jobs%27%20That%20Aren%27t%20Quite%20What%20They%20Seem" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdirty-jobs-things-arent-quite-what-they-seem.html&title=15%20Things%20About%20Discovery%27s%20%27Dirty%20Jobs%27%20That%20Aren%27t%20Quite%20What%20They%20Seem" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdirty-jobs-things-arent-quite-what-they-seem.html&description=15%20Things%20About%20Discovery%27s%20%27Dirty%20Jobs%27%20That%20Aren%27t%20Quite%20What%20They%20Seem" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./20-famous-people-that-look-like-they-would-smell-horrible.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 Famous People That Look Like They Would Smell Horrible">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./xander-hastings-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-163561-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Xander Hastings Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
