The agents make a ton of money selling fancy, expensive homes to their clients. And every episode offers up plenty of epic homes to gasp at. While the Selling Sunset cast has all become famous since the show premiered in 2019, Heather Rae Young has gotten a lot of attention. This could be because of her marriage to Tarek El Moussa and their own real estate reality show, The Flipping El Moussas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans have many questions about Selling Sunset, including whether <a href=#>Heather Rae Young gets along with her co-stars</a>. People also want to know how much the cast members earn. Heather Rae Young shared that she won't appear much in season 7 of Selling Sunset. How will that affect her salary?</p><h2 id=does-heather-rae-young-earn-a-salary-from-selling-sunset>Does Heather Rae Young Earn A Salary From Selling Sunset?</h2><p>There are often <a href=#>huge news stories about the Selling Sunset cast</a>. None of them have lives that are uninteresting or dull. It's easy to think that Netflix pays them big bucks to star in such a popular and successful reality series. After all, the cast members are always dressed to the nines and driving fancy cars in every scene. Does that mean that Heather Rae Young earned a high salary from seasons 1 through 6 of Selling Sunset?</p><p>The Selling Sunset cast doesn't make money from the Netflix series. That makes sense since they are real estate agents who make money from selling homes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/selling-sunset-mary-fitzgerald-heather-el-moussa-emma-hernan.jpg><p>In 2020, Christine Quinn told Refinery 29 that she covered her own beauty costs when filming Selling Sunset. She said, “Netflix doesn't pay for anything. I pay for my own hair and makeup and wardrobe and everything like that, and it's worth it."</p><p>It's possible that this is true of the rest of the cast, including Heather Rae Young.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Does Heather Rae Young Really Feel About Tarek El Moussa's Kids?</a></span></p><p>Even though Heather Rae Young won't be featured much in season 7 of Selling Sunset, she won't miss out on any money. After she gave birth to her baby boy on January 31st, 2023, Heather likely took some time off to be at home with her newborn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As soon as Heather got back to work, she went back to earning a commission from the properties that she sells.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/heather-rae-young.jpg><p>Mary Vander talked about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oppenheim Group commission</a> in an interview with Metro.co.uk. She said, "Typically the commission on a purchase is 5%. The 5% is split into half for the person who represents the seller and the person who brings the buyer, so you end up with 2.5%. If I bring the buyer, I get 2.5% of the purchase price, but then Jason will take his cut because he’s the broker and he has the liability. Typically for a brokerage, it’s about 70/30 split. I would keep 70% out of the 2.5% and he would take 30%. And then we have to pay taxes.’</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maya added to Metro.co.uk, "It’s not as big as you think!"</p><h2 id=how-much-money-does-heather-rae-young-make-from-her-real-estate-career>How Much Money Does Heather Rae Young Make From Her Real Estate Career?</h2><p>Although Maya Vander said that the commission is smaller than fans assume, the agents at the Oppenheim Group definitely make a lot of money. And since many of them have become famous, they have a few different income sources.</p><p>According to Us Weekly, Heather makes thousands of dollars when she shares a sponsored post on Instagram. She could make as much as $5,000-$9,000 for every photo or video.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/heather-and-tarek-el-moussa.jpg><p>Us Weekly also reported that Heather made $65,250 in commission from the houses she sold in season 5 of Selling Sunset. She made $419,850 in commission for season 4.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Did Tarek El Moussa Meet His Wife Heather Rae Young?</a></span></p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Heather has a net worth of $3 million. Since she hasn't earned a salary from Selling Sunset, her net worth comes from her real estate success. It's amazing to look at the amount of money that she and her co-stars have made over the years.</p><h2 id=what-did-heather-rae-young-say-about-season-7-of-selling-sunset>What Did Heather Rae Young Say About Season 7 Of Selling Sunset?</h2><p>In 2022, fans found out that Selling Sunset was getting a season 6 and also a season 7. This wasn't totally shocking news considering how many people love watching the real estate show. And while season 7 isn't out yet, people are talking about it a lot.</p><p>According to Page Six, Heather Rae Young explained in March 2023 that she hadn't heard anything about shooting season 7 of Selling Sunset.</p><p>Heather said, “I’ve been off maternity leave and I’ve been excited to get back to work and so far I have not been called back. It’s been a little frustrating. So [I’m] not sure what’s been going on.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/heather-rae-young-1.jpg><p>It sounds like Heather was surprised that she wasn't going to film many episodes of season 7 of the popular reality series. Fans have seen Heather go through massive life changes since the very first episode. And it has been fun seeing her find love and so much happiness.</p><p>A few seasons into Selling Sunset, Heather shared that she had fallen for Tarek El Moussa. And in season 6, which was released on Netflix in May 2023, Heather was pregnant with her first child. In these episodes, her co-stars often commented on her bump and she chatted about her pregnancy experience.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why The Flipping El Moussas Bombed With Fans Despite Tarek El Moussa's Notable Fame</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It turns out that while Heather will <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">appear in season 7 of Selling Sunset</a>, her role will be smaller than it has been in previous seasons.</p><p>According to Us Weekly, she said, “I’m in a little bit of 7 that I know of. So we’ll see."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/heather-rae-young-tarek-el-moussa.jpg><p>Season 6 of Selling Sunset is not missing any drama. There are lots of fights between Chrishell Stause and Nicole Young. And Heather is the only cast member who got along with new co-star Bre Tiesi.</p><p>It will be strange only seeing Heather in a little bit of Selling Sunset season 7. She has been a real fixture on the reality series. Her friendly, sunny personality is always welcome whether she's sitting in the office or grabbing dinner with her friends. While Heather might wish that she was in more of the next season, at least she didn't miss out on a huge amount of money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIympqedqWKxqrCMoZyarJiav26%2BwJ5ksqelo7RuuM6snGaZlqmys3nNqKtmmpWeu6h5xZ6Yra2imrFutc1mqp6knJ67qHnSrqWsnaRiwKat0qilZm9f</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-money-did-heather-rae-young-lose-after-not-being-featured-in-selling-sunset-season-7.html&text=Did%20Heather%20Rae%20Young%20Lose%20A%20Fortune%20After%20Not%20Being%20Featured%20In%20Selling%20Sunset%20Season%207%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-money-did-heather-rae-young-lose-after-not-being-featured-in-selling-sunset-season-7.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-money-did-heather-rae-young-lose-after-not-being-featured-in-selling-sunset-season-7.html&title=Did%20Heather%20Rae%20Young%20Lose%20A%20Fortune%20After%20Not%20Being%20Featured%20In%20Selling%20Sunset%20Season%207%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-much-money-did-heather-rae-young-lose-after-not-being-featured-in-selling-sunset-season-7.html&title=Did%20Heather%20Rae%20Young%20Lose%20A%20Fortune%20After%20Not%20Being%20Featured%20In%20Selling%20Sunset%20Season%207%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-money-did-heather-rae-young-lose-after-not-being-featured-in-selling-sunset-season-7.html&title=Did%20Heather%20Rae%20Young%20Lose%20A%20Fortune%20After%20Not%20Being%20Featured%20In%20Selling%20Sunset%20Season%207%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-money-did-heather-rae-young-lose-after-not-being-featured-in-selling-sunset-season-7.html&description=Did%20Heather%20Rae%20Young%20Lose%20A%20Fortune%20After%20Not%20Being%20Featured%20In%20Selling%20Sunset%20Season%207%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./does-yao-ming-have-a-son-daughter-yao-qinlei-and-kids.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does Yao Ming Have A Son?
