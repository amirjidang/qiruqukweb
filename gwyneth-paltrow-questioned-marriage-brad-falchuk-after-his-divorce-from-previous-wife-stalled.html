Despite that, many of Paltrow's fans have no idea that according to a report, her marriage to Brad Falchuk was in danger of not happening at one point.</p><h2 id=why-did-gwyneth-paltrow-question-marrying-brad-falchuk>Why Did Gwyneth Paltrow Question Marrying Brad Falchuk?</h2><p>In the years since Gwyneth Paltrow became famous, she has been linked to several stars. Some of the people Paltrow publicly dated include Robert Sean Leonard, Brad Pitt, Ben Affleck, Luke Wilson, and Aaron Eckhart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gwenyth-paltrow-arriving-at-the-palazzo-del-cinema-for-the-contagion-premiere-during-the-68th-venice-film-festival-in-venice-italy.jpg><p>After dating all of those stars, Paltrow met, dated, married, and had kids with Coldplay's lead singer Chris Martin. Sadly for the former couple, Paltrow and Martin's marriage came to an end after more than a decade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Paltrow and Martin broke up, he has gone on to date the movie star Dakota Johnson. According to reports, <a href=#>Paltrow approves of Martin's relationship with Johnson</a> and the former couple's daughter <a href=#>Apple Martin reportedly likes her dad's girlfriend</a>.</p><p>As for Paltrow, she has moved on as well, and she even walked down the aisle a second time. In 2018, Paltrow married a writer, producer, and director who co-created Glee and American Horror Story named Brad Falchuk.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow Avoided Speaking Directly To The Restaurant Staff And Instead Ordered Through Her Personal Assistant</a></span></p><p>According to reports and websites like Whos Dated Who, Paltrow and Falchuk got together several years before they tied the knot.

In the years that followed, Paltrow would reprise her Glee role several times as she ultimately appeared in five episodes of hit show. During those appearances, Paltrow and Falchuk got to know each other and reportedly began dating in 2014.</p><p>After the world found out that Falchuk and Paltrow were a couple in 2015, the pair reportedly got engaged in November 2017. Almost a year later, they walked down the aisle together in September 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gwyneth-paltrow-and-brad-falchuk-side-by-side.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to a Star Magazine report, Paltrow and Falchuk's path to their wedding wasn't as simple as things may have appeared to some. When Falchuk and Paltrow first met, both of them were married to other people as she was still with Chris Martin and Suzanne Bukinik was his wife.</p><p>By the time Falchuk and Paltrow became a couple, both of them were in the process of dissolving their first marriages. According to Star Magazine's 2015 report, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paltrow began to question her relationship with Falchuk</a> because his divorce seemed to be proceeding slowly.</p><p>"Gwyn is questioning the relationship," a source told Star magazine at the time. She finds it odd and embarrassing that Brad hasn’t moved forward with his divorce. She wants him to settle things with his wife and move on.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Gwyneth Paltrow’s Diet Actually Wildly Unhealthy?

That said, it is easy to believe that the speed of Falchuk's divorce could cause strain in his relationship with Paltrow.</p><p>After all, most people have had the experience of a past relationship causing strain in a current one. As a result, the details of Star Magazine's reporting seem credible on a surface level. On top of that, looking at the timeline of Paltrow and Falchuk's divorces, the differences are obvious.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gwyneth-paltrow-and-chris-martin-paparazzi-photo.jpg><p>According to Whos Dated Who, Paltrow and her ex-husband Chris Martin separated in March 2014. In April 2015 Paltrow filed for divorce, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they reached a settlement agreement in July 2016</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, Falchuk and his ex-wife Suzanne Bukinik reportedly separated in 2013, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it wasn't until May 2016 that they finalized their divorce</a>. Of course, lots of divorces take years to make their way through the courts. However, since Paltrow finalized her divorce much quicker, her reported frustrations could be understandable.</p><h2 id=are-gwyneth-paltrow-and-brad-falchuk-happy>Are Gwyneth Paltrow And Brad Falchuk Happy?</h2><p>Whether there is truth to Star Magazine's report that Gwyneth Paltrow questioned her relationship with Brad Falchuk, the couple got married in the end. However, after Paltrow and Falchuk walked down the aisle, their relationship proceeded surprisingly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gwyneth-paltrow-looking-lovingly-at-brad-falchuk.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Paltrow and Falchuk walked down the aisle, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it took them a year to actually move in together</a>. While speaking to Harper's Bazaar in 2020, Paltrow talked about how funny she found people's reaction to the couple's decision not to live together at first to be.</p><p>“I thought it was really interesting how resonant that was for people. One of my best friends was like, ‘That is my dream. Don’t ever move in.’” The magazine's article also revealed that before they lived together, Paltrow and Falchuk lived separate lives three days a week.</p><p>Finally, Paltrow explained to Harper's Bazaar what she learned from living apart from her husband for a year. “I think it certainly helps with preserving mystery and also preserving the idea that this person has their own life. So this is something I’m trying to remain aware of now as we merge together.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow Is Being Sued After A Ski Accident That Took Place Seven Years Ago, But The Countersuit Was Questioned Because Of Taylor Swift</a></span></p><p>Of course, nobody aside from Paltrow, Falchuk, and potentially their loved ones knows if they are currently happy together or not. However, based on what Paltrow told Entertainment Tonight in 2022, her relationship with Falchuk is very strong.</p><p>At the time Paltrow spoke to Entertainment Tonight, she'd rekindled a relationship with her ex-boyfriend Brad Pitt. As Paltrow explained, Falchuk is so confident in their marriage that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he had no problem with her being friends with Pitt</a>.</p><p>"My husband is probably like the least judgmental, most secure man in our relationship, so I think he totally respects [the friendship]." Paltrow also spoke about the "amazing chemistry" she shares with Falchuk and how he makes her feel.
