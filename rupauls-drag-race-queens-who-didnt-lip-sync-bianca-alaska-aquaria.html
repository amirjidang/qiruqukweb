Watching queens lip sync is <a href=#>one of the most entertaining parts of each episode</a>, and it allows viewers to get a better sense of what type of performer each contestant truly is. We’re huge lip sync for your life fans around here, and if you’re a diehard RPDR fan, you know there is an exclusive group of queens who have never had to do so on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That’s right: There are a few queens from the varying seasons of RPDR who <a href=#>have never fallen into the bottom two</a>, having to lip sync to fight for their lives in the competition. It doesn’t happen every season, and sometimes two queens from a season never end up lip-syncing either. Here are the 12 queens from the first 14 seasons of RPDR who have never lip-synced for their lives on the show.</p><h2 id=nina-flowers-season-1><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Nina Flowers: Season 1</span></h2><p>Our Season 1 runner-up Nina Flowers pioneered the “alternative” drag style on RPDR. I mean, come on: Nina was the first queen on the show to push the boundaries between femininity and masculinity via the art of drag on such a large platform. She crushed the competition throughout its entirety, and came in second to the original Drag Race winner, Bebe Zahara Benet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tyra-sanchez-season-2><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Tyra Sanchez: Season 2</span></h2><p>The artist formerly known as Tyra Sanchez was our Season 2 winner, y’all. Tyra brought the drama throughout the duration of Season 2, and she showcased consistent and great drag while on our screens. She made her way to the very end of the competition without having to lip sync for her life once, and she ended up walking away with the Season 2 crown.</p><h2 id=alaska-season-5><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Alaska: Season 5</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jumping ahead a few seasons, one of the fans most favorite queens, Alaska, never fell into the bottom two during her time in the competition once. She headed into the finale of Season 5 pretty confident, and ultimately <a href=#>lost the crown to Jinkx Monsoon</a>, and she took it pretty hard (if you know, you know). Alas, Alaska made her return in All-Stars 2 where we got to see her lip sync for the win a few times, eventually snatching the crown and a place in the Drag Race Hall of Fame.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Queens From RuPaul's Drag Race Started Their Own Podcasts</a></span></p><h2 id=bianca-del-rio-and-courtney-act-season-6><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Bianca Del Rio and Courtney Act: Season 6</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Season 6 was the first season where we saw two queens make it to the finale of RPDR without having to lip sync for their lives. And, it’s safe to say that both of these queens are pretty iconic: It’s Bianca Del Rio and Courtney Act. As the <a href=#>winner of Season 6</a>, Bianca turned it out in every single challenge, and didn’t even fall to a low placement throughout the competition. Everyone’s favorite Australian queen, Courtney, also didn’t fall into the bottom two while competing at Drag Race. In the end, they both made it to the top three, and Bianca ended up becoming the crowned queen (and one of the best winners out there) of Season 6.</p><h2 id=violet-chachki-season-7><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Violet Chachki: Season 7</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Season 7 was a controversial season</a> of Drag Race, and we got to watch as our proclaimed winner didn’t hit the bottom two once. In the end, we got to see Violet Chachki show off her lip-syncing skills when each queen performed an original mixed track at the finale. Many thought that we’d see Ginger Minj get crowned for her great performance in comedy and acting challenges throughout Season 7. However, Violet reigned supreme, and became the second-youngest winner ever at the time of her crowning.</p><h2 id=kim-chi-season-8><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kim Chi: Season 8</span></h2><p>Another fan favorite, Kim Chi made it all the way to the finale of Season 8 without having to lip sync once. When the season was airing, fans loved Kim Chi for her innovative makeup looks and rich social media presence. She’s even been regarded as the original “Instagram queen,” and currently she runs her extremely successful makeup brand, <a href=#>KimChi Chic Beauty</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These RuPaul's Drag Race Winners Are Worth An Absolute Fortune</a></span></p><h2 id=sasha-velour-season-9><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Sasha Velour: Season 9</span></h2><p>Everyone knows that Sasha Velour never fell into the bottom two during the duration of Season 9. But when the infamous lip sync for the crown twist was implemented during the Season 9 finale, one thing was for certain: Sasha was going to show everyone just how great of a lip syncer she was. And that, she did. As fans of Drag Race, we all know that Sasha’s performance of “So Emotional” against Shea Coulee during the Season 9 finale is one of the most (if not the) most iconic lip syncs of Drag Race herstory. The rose petal reveal from under Sasha’s wig was truly a moment, one that will go down in the minds of every fan of Drag Race forever, and ultimately <a href=#>led to her Season 9 win</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aquaria-season-10><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Aquaria: Season 10</span></h2><p>As the current youngest winner of RPDR ever, Aquaria was known in the drag world before she even was cast on Season 10. And when she did walk into that werk room, the other queens were gagged. We went the entire season without watching Aquaria’s lip-syncing skills, until she participated in the lip sync for the crown against Eureka O’Hara and Kameron Micheals, eventually coming out as the crowned winner of Season 10.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'RuPaul's Drag Race': Fans Think This Was The Best Season</a></span></p><h2 id=gigi-goode-season-12><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Gigi Goode: Season 12</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, Gigi Goode did lip sync during Season 12, but she was lip-syncing for the win against Widow Von’Du in episode one. Many regular seasons of Drag Race never see queens lip-syncing for the win of an episode, but Season 12 was formatted differently. Alas, Gigi did make it to the finale with a coveted four wins, and we watched her participate in the lip sync for the crown twist that many finales typically showcase in later seasons of Drag Race. She <a href=#>finished as a runner up</a> to Jaida Essence Hall.</p><h2 id=gottmik-and-ros-eacute-season-13><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Gottmik and Rosé: Season 13</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the first time, we saw another set of two queens not lip sync for their lives throughout the season, but neither one of them walked away with the crown (unlike Season 6). However, both Gottmik and Rosé did amazing throughout their times on Season 13, and we saw them both lip sync in the first episode of the series in another weird twist. Of course, we did see Rosé lip sync again for a win in one of the season's earlier episodes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiprqiRqrm0ecOrmKBlopawpnnQrpyepqNixKm7jJ2gnaakYrmqvIyssKebXZe2orrCmmSapJGouKJ5wKqsmqqZlnw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frupauls-drag-race-queens-who-didnt-lip-sync-bianca-alaska-aquaria.html&text=Rupaul%27s%20Drag%20Race%3a%20Queens%20Who%20Never%20Had%20To%20Lip%20Sync%20On%20Their%20Season&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frupauls-drag-race-queens-who-didnt-lip-sync-bianca-alaska-aquaria.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frupauls-drag-race-queens-who-didnt-lip-sync-bianca-alaska-aquaria.html&title=Rupaul%27s%20Drag%20Race%3a%20Queens%20Who%20Never%20Had%20To%20Lip%20Sync%20On%20Their%20Season" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frupauls-drag-race-queens-who-didnt-lip-sync-bianca-alaska-aquaria.html&title=Rupaul%27s%20Drag%20Race%3a%20Queens%20Who%20Never%20Had%20To%20Lip%20Sync%20On%20Their%20Season" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frupauls-drag-race-queens-who-didnt-lip-sync-bianca-alaska-aquaria.html&title=Rupaul%27s%20Drag%20Race%3a%20Queens%20Who%20Never%20Had%20To%20Lip%20Sync%20On%20Their%20Season" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frupauls-drag-race-queens-who-didnt-lip-sync-bianca-alaska-aquaria.html&description=Rupaul%27s%20Drag%20Race%3a%20Queens%20Who%20Never%20Had%20To%20Lip%20Sync%20On%20Their%20Season" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./scarlett-johansson-makes-bible-verses-sound-sexy-in-sexy-bible-track-20152810.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Scarlett Johansson Makes Bible Verses Sound Sexy in &amp;quot;Sexy Bible&amp;quot; Track">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rozonda-chilli-thomas-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rozonda Chilli Thomas Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
