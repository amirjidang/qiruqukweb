In 1998, Raynor was replaced by Travis Barker who continues to play drums and percussion to this day.</p><p>With members who have come and gone, especially after spending years of their life together, arguments and irritations were sure to ensue. After first performing twenty years ago, what do the guys currently think of each other? Here is how close the original members of Blink-182 are today.</p><h2 id=tom-delonge-amp-mark-hoppus-had-a-strenuous-relationship-post-breakup><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus Had A Strenuous Relationship Post-Breakup</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus played shows side by side for years. They both came back after the band's hiatus, performing from 2009 on. While Mark is still a member of the band, Tom left in 2015. DeLonge didn't seem to hold any particular grudges, but ended up reeling back in terms of communicating with his previous bandmates. In this time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he would reach out to Mark occasionally</a>, but did not maintain a close relationship with him.</p><h2 id=on-accident-tom-delonge-amp-mark-hoppus-rekindled-their-friendship><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>On Accident, Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus Rekindled Their Friendship</span></h2><p>In 2019, complete coincidence brought Tom and Mark back together. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DeLonge called Hoppus for help in the divorce</a> he was filing with now ex-wife Jennifer, and in that call learned that <a href=#>Mark was battling with cancer</a>. This reeling discovery prompted Tom to make a change, and he quickly became intentional about rekindling their friendship. The two are now as close as ever and continue to keep in touch on a regular basis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Blink-182 Member, Travis Barker Is Worth Today</a></span></p><h2 id=is-tom-delonge-down-for-a-blink-182-reunion><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Is Tom DeLonge Down For A Blink-182 Reunion?</span></h2><p><a href=#>Mark Hoppus is the only founding member of Blink-182 that continues to perform</a> in the band, as Scott Raynor left in 1998 and was replaced by Travis Barker and Tom DeLonge left in 2015. There have been rumors going around for years about a reunion where Tom comes back to play with the band, but how does he feel about it? In an interview, he shared that his main priority was making sure Mark gets better, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">But, yeah, I'm down</a>."</p><h2 id=scott-raynor-seems-to-keep-to-himself-nowadays><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Scott Raynor Seems To Keep To Himself Nowadays</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scott Raynor had a rocky period of life, only playing with the band for six years before allegedly being fired for his drinking problem. He has since sought treatment and bounced around to perform with various artists. Raynor does not appear to have any social media presence, and there have not been any reports from the other Blink-182 members of him continuing a relationship with them.</p><h2 id=mark-hoppus-amp-his-wife-attended-travis-barker-39-s-wedding-in-italy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mark Hoppus & His Wife Attended Travis Barker's Wedding In Italy</span></h2><p>In May of this year, Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker and his wife <strong><a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a> </strong>had a wedding ceremony in Italy. <a href=#>Among the several famous faces in attendance</a> was bandmate Mark Hoppus and his wife, Skye. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The two flew to this destination wedding</a> to show their love and support for the new couple, as well as spend some time sightseeing in Italy's beautiful cities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Tease Blink 182's Tom DeLonge In Recent Post</a></span></p><h2 id=why-didn-39-t-tom-delonge-make-an-appearance-at-travis-39-s-wedding><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Why Didn't Tom DeLonge Make An Appearance At Travis's Wedding?</span></h2><p>It seems as though <a href=#>Rob Kardashian wasn't the only person who decided to skip the Kardashian-Barker wedding</a>. Tom DeLonge and his wife Rita Marie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">were not in attendance during the ceremony</a> and reception in Italy. He did not release any official statements as to why, but fans are guessing that he either doesn't feel close enough to Travis anymore to fly across the country, or that he was tending to personal matters.</p><h2 id=travis-barker-amp-mark-hoppus-feel-like-39-brothers-39><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Travis Barker & Mark Hoppus Feel Like 'Brothers'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Around this time last year, Mark Hoppus was in chemotherapy for his cancer treatment.
