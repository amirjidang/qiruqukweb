Since her TV debut in 2002, the Texas-born beauty has not only launched a booming acting career but&nbsp;also a music platform. Her music career has really skyrocketed and she's sold over 20 million records worldwide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It goes without saying that Selena has proven herself to be quite a force to be reckoned with. But despite all the success and fame, she's had a lot of low moments -- most of which stemmed from her feuds with several of her Hollywood peers. While Selena has rarely ever spoken badly about others, these 12 celebs didn't have the best encounter with the "Hands To Myself" singer, or so it appears.</p><p>But with every foe comes a friend - here are 12 celebs who've surprisingly feuded with Selena Gomez (and eight who absolutely love her).</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus---feud><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Miley Cyrus - Feud</span></h2><p>In 2014, in the midst of her "Bangerz" world tour, Miley Cyrus entertained fans as she grabbed a cardboard cutout of Selena Gomez while singing her song, "FU", in Milan, Italy, while audience members enjoyed the snark.</p><p>Miley and Selena have a history together; they both feuded over the same guy - Nick Jonas. He dated both of them during his teenage years, and his romance with Selena was longer-lasting than his fling with Miley.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-rock---feud><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Chris Rock - Feud</span></h2><p>In 2016, Chris Rock made some not-so-nice comments about Selena. He rudely described her as a poor man's version of Beyoncé. This totally uncalled-for comment got the comedian into a lot of trouble, as Selena's fans lashed out at Chris for daring to draw comparisons between the two Hollywood stars. Gomez never responded to what was supposed to be an innocent joke.</p><h2 id=ariana-grande---feud><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Ariana Grande - Feud</span></h2><p>While this is more of a rumor, it's believed that Selena and Ariana Grande aren't exactly friends. Fans are well aware of Ariana's close ties with Miley Cyrus. Given that the "Wrecking Ball" hitmaker isn't fond of her frenemy, Selena, could that potentially mean that Ariana isn't welcoming the idea of being friends with Selena, either? Ari has never made it a secret that she always has&nbsp;her friend's back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stefano-gabbana---feud><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Stefano Gabbana - Feud</span></h2><p>In 2018, Stefano Gabbana left Selena's fans in an uproar when he deemed the former Disney Channel star, "ugly." The co-founder of the Dolce & Gabbana fashion brand&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">came under fire</a> on social media after making the comment, with thousands of fans hitting back at the designer and his bullying attitude towards a woman. On top of that, Stefano never apologized for his remarks.</p><h2 id=demi-lovato---feud><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Demi Lovato - Feud</span></h2><p>While Demi Lovato and Selena were once close pals, their friendship has had its ups and downs -- at this point, it honestly seems as if the two have gone their separate ways for good.</p><p>In 2014, during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live, the show's host,&nbsp;Andy Cohen, asked why Demi <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had unfollowed Selena</a> on Instagram, to which she responded,&nbsp;"I think it's one of those things where people changed, and people grow apart."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Celebs Who Are Part Of Selena Gomez And Taylor Swift’s Inner Circle</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-prentice---feud><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Justin Prentice - Feud</span></h2><p>13 Reasons Why star, Justin Prentice, found himself in a lot of trouble after appearing to have made several comments targeting Selena Gomez in May of 2017. From his official Instagram account, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin apparently said</a>,&nbsp;"So glad you produce our show #thosewhocantactproduce #knowyoplacebooboo," leaving fans completely stunned. He later claimed he was hacked, but do you believe it?</p><h2 id=hailey-baldwin---feud><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Hailey Baldwin - Feud</span></h2><p>Hailey Baldwin Bieber and Selena Gomez have been feuding, it seems. But it's probably because of their fans attacking one another on social media. Since Justin Bieber went on to marry Hailey, just months after splitting from Gomez, Selena's fans aimed their insults at Hailey, creating a false narrative that's now developed into a feud between the two ladies.</p><h2 id=madison-beer---feud><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Madison Beer - Feud</span></h2><p>Madison Beer found herself in hot water when she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dined with Justin's wife</a>, Hailey Baldwin Bieber, out in Los Angeles, while supposedly having shared a close friendship with Selena in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it's unclear whether Madison and Selena are still cool with one another, fans didn't like the fact that the singer was spending time with Hailey one bit, calling her a "traitor."</p><h2 id=lorde---feud><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Lorde - Feud</span></h2><p>Lorde didn't receive quite the reaction she'd hoped for as a feminist, after dissing Selena's song "Come & Get It" by shaming it for its raunchy lyrics. Taylor Swift's bestie wasn't impressed with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">choice of words</a> used in the song, insisting:&nbsp;"I'm a feminist and the theme of her song is, ‘'When you're ready, come and get it from me,' I'm sick of women being portrayed this way."</p><h2 id=bella-hadid---feud><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Bella Hadid - Feud</span></h2><p>When Selena Gomez started seeing R&B singer, The Weeknd, Bella Hadid was livid because she apparently had plans to eventually reconcile with her on-off boyfriend. He'd taken a break from Bella to focus on his career. It apparently resulted in a lot of tension between her and Selena, given that she was in the way of Bella Hadid getting back with her ex.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Best Moments Of Selena Gomez’s Career From 2002 To 2020, In Pictures</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-weeknd---feud><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The Weeknd - Feud</span></h2><p>Soon after his split from Selena, The Weeknd was featured on Nicki Minaj's song, "Thought I Knew You," which many believe featured lyrics that were aimed at his ex-girlfriend. The Weeknd sings <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">about a complicated relationship</a>, adding that the person he was seeing isn't who he thought she was. The release of the song, so close to when Selena and her former beau had just called it quits, is interesting.</p><h2 id=jake-paul---feud><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jake Paul - Feud</span></h2><p>After cutting ties with Disney and abruptly leaving his show, Bizaardvark, in the middle of its series, Jake Paul threw shade at Selena Gomez as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he tried to draw comparisons</a>&nbsp;between himself and Selena Gomez.</p><p>Jake wasn't happy with Disney, so he quit. And while he got a lot of backlash for it, he argued that people like Selena can do it without the same response.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-aniston---friend><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jennifer Aniston - Friend</span></h2><p>In what seems to be quite the surprise friendship, Selena and Jennifer Aniston have been close buddies for years. In fact, it's even believed that the former Friends star helped her pal stay on the path of sobriety. Apparently, Gomez reaches out to Jennifer whenever she feels the need to gain clarity and advice from someone with wisdom and knowledge.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift---friend><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Taylor Swift - Friend</span></h2><p>Perhaps her closest friendship in Hollywood is with Taylor Swift. The two met while they were both still dating two of the Jonas brothers - Joe and Nick - and have remained on good terms ever since. From sleepovers to supporting one another with their music, these girls do it all together, and it's apparent that Selena cherishes their friendship.</p><h2 id=niall-horan---friend><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Niall Horan - Friend</span></h2><p>Niall Horan, who was once said to have been crushing on Selena Gomez, has been a loyal friend and supporter of the singer for as long as fans can remember. Even when he was still part of One Direction, Niall had nothing but positive things to say about Selena and any encounters they had in the past. He's even plugged her music on his social media pages.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hailey Bieber And Selena Gomez Run Into Each Other But Keep It Classy</a></span></p><h2 id=taylor-lautner---friend><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Taylor Lautner - Friend</span></h2><p>Taylor Lautner famously dated Selena in the early years of their careers, and though their romance didn't work out, they've remained friends ever since. The two have shared a close bond and Taylor has supposedly always been a shoulder for Selena to cry on when things became too much for her. It's nice to stay friends with an ex, that's for sure.</p><h2 id=cardi-b---friend><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Cardi B - Friend</span></h2><p>Selena became friends with Cardi B following their collaboration on DJ Snake's "Taki Taki" in 2018. The song was a smash hit, but it was the bond she built with Cardi that's sure to last a lifetime.</p><p>Speaking of working with Selena, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardi previously dished</a>:&nbsp;"When I met her, she was such a sweet, adorable person. She's really what you see. She's really a sweetheart."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amy-schumer---friend><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Amy Schumer - Friend</span></h2><p>Just months after professing her love for Amy Schumer, Selena made her debut on the comedienne's comedy sketch show, Inside Amy Schumer, playing a lead singer in one of the segments. But apparently, their get-together only came about after the blonde heard about how much of a fan Selena was -- and the two are said to have been friends ever since.</p><h2 id=gigi-hadid---friend><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Gigi Hadid - Friend</span></h2><p>Though there was said to have been a short-lived feud between Selena and Bella Hadid over The Weeknd, Gigi Hadid apparently never involved herself in that situation. She's been friends with Selena for years, thanks to her own ties to Taylor Swift and her circle of pals. Selena and Gigi have even traveled the world together and are still said to be close.</p><h2 id=nick-jonas---friend><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Nick Jonas - Friend</span></h2><p>Again, it's good to stay on good terms with an ex. Selena Gomez definitely knows a thing or two about that since she's also said to be friendly with Nick Jonas, who has since married Indian actress, Priyanka Chopra. Though Selena and her ex don't see each other often, it's said that there's nothing but love between the two...and that's how it's supposed to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena Gomez And Taylor Swift – A Famous Friendship We Can Get Behind</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoa2WTmrmmrtJmrqGnppp6tMHRqamiq5mjtK3FjJ%2BcrpyVmXq4tdOhZKydnJq7onnGqKSesl1teri0zmaYm6ufocK1scuyZKWnppp6qbHRaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f12-celebs-whove-surprisingly-feuded-with-selena-gomez-8-who-absolutely-love-her.html&text=12%20Celebs%20Whove%20Surprisingly%20Feuded%20With%20Selena%20Gomez%20%288%20Who%20Absolutely%20Love%20Her%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f12-celebs-whove-surprisingly-feuded-with-selena-gomez-8-who-absolutely-love-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f12-celebs-whove-surprisingly-feuded-with-selena-gomez-8-who-absolutely-love-her.html&title=12%20Celebs%20Whove%20Surprisingly%20Feuded%20With%20Selena%20Gomez%20%288%20Who%20Absolutely%20Love%20Her%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f12-celebs-whove-surprisingly-feuded-with-selena-gomez-8-who-absolutely-love-her.html&title=12%20Celebs%20Whove%20Surprisingly%20Feuded%20With%20Selena%20Gomez%20%288%20Who%20Absolutely%20Love%20Her%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f12-celebs-whove-surprisingly-feuded-with-selena-gomez-8-who-absolutely-love-her.html&title=12%20Celebs%20Whove%20Surprisingly%20Feuded%20With%20Selena%20Gomez%20%288%20Who%20Absolutely%20Love%20Her%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f12-celebs-whove-surprisingly-feuded-with-selena-gomez-8-who-absolutely-love-her.html&description=12%20Celebs%20Whove%20Surprisingly%20Feuded%20With%20Selena%20Gomez%20%288%20Who%20Absolutely%20Love%20Her%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-biggest-sleazebags-in-sports.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Biggest Sleazebags In Sports">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ridiculously-expensive-things-emma-watson-has-bought.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Ridiculously Expensive Things Emma Watson Has Bought">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
