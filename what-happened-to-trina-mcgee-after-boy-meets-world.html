ABC had their very own version of a classic comedy titled Boy Meets World, which they broadcast between 1993 and 2000.</p><p>The main protagonist of the show was known as Cory Matthews, whose life the series tracked from his days in elementary school all the way to the time he started a family of his own. That character was portrayed by actor Ben Savage.</p><p>William Daniels, Will Friedle, Danielle Fishel and Trina McGee were all part of <a href=#>the Boy Meets World cast</a> as well. Like many other shows in its time, the Michael Jacobs and April Kelly series often <a href=#>tackled real-life issues</a> like sexual abuse, addiction and relationship problems.</p><p>McGee has been one of the <a href=#>cast members to make brutal confessions</a> about their time on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Famous People Who Made Appearances On 'Boy Meets World'</a></span></p><h2 id=what-character-did-trina-mcgee-play-in-boy-meets-world><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>What Character Did Trina McGee Play In Boy Meets World?</span></h2><p>Trina McGee only joined the cast of Boy Meets World in Season 5 as a recurring character, before she was promoted to be a regular in the final two seasons of the show.</p><p>The actress was given the role of Angela Moore, who was best friends with Danielle Fishel’s Topanga Lawrence in college.
